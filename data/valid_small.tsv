1788	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 more and more people start to use computers, goes more and more into the dark aged. While computer @MONTH1 be helpful in some cases, they are also making people excercize less, most @CAPS1 many people are nature, and more people are becoming awkward. So are computer advancement recently worth society becoming less interactive? The answer is no. With more thing to do on the computer people arent getting enough exercize to keep up a healthy regimens. Kids would rather waste time on the computer than go out play. @NUM1 years ago, when most that many people had computers, you could see people outside playing and having fun with each other, But now, when you look outside, no one is on the local playground having fun and exercising, they are on the internet. ""@PERCENT1 of kids, who spend most of their time on the computer, are over-weight and unhealthy, compared to the @PERCENT2 of kids who are outside playing and a healthy weight."" says @PERSON1, @CAPS2. So really the problem to over-weight, its lack of exercize from the computers. Not only are people getting less exercize, they are also not experiencing the healty of nature. With less people going going outside, of exercize, waste nature healty because no-one gets to use it, and harm social skills and family relationships. So please, get off the computer and enjoy life."	1788	
1789	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 Time @CAPS1 me tell you what I think of computers there is nothing wrong with people being on computers. I say this because us as kids really do need computers for projects and school work. Also because what if your parents want to move or get a better job but have no car they can use they're computer. Computers actually help the human mind. If you get bored then get on the computer sit back and relax while I explain. In addition I'm not saying that you can use your computer for everything say for an example your teacher gives you an assignment and you can't find it in your book your going to use the computer. If you need pictures for a project but your not an very good artist then you can use your computer. so at the end computer's aren't so bad after all. For an example my mom doesn't have a car or know how to drive. So when she needs to look for a job and no one is there to take her she get's on the internet and find one. Also when it was time for her to move she got on the computer and found a @LOCATION1 house. So like I said computer's are not as bad as people think. When kid's get bored and it's snowing outside and nothing on t.v. Then they can go on the computer, it's not like they don't have educational sites. They have first in math and math for fun. So don't think it's just websites to chat with your friends. In conclusion don't make it seem as through the computer isn't useful because it is. The computer even teach's me things every now and then. So I would say computers @CAPS2! So don't be such a grumpy person because they probably help you sometimes."	1789	
1790	1	"Dear Local newspaper, Have you been spending a good portion of your time on computers? Do you think it is effecting you in anyway? Well in this writing piece I am going to tell you how I believe the computers effect you aand everyone else. My first piece of information for the way computers effect people is if they are on the omputer playing games, emailing or listening to music, that is more time you miss spending with thier family or going outside. If they miss time to spend with thier family then you could slowly start drifting apart from them, especially if they don't live near you. One day when that person passed away and you think back you are going to wish you weren't on the compuer three times they were over, you are going to wish you were down there spending time with them. If you miss going outside that is a whole new thing you are missing the sunshine, the snow or whatever kind of temparature there is outside and either way being outside in the fresh air is healthy and so much better than being inside on a computer. The second way computer could effect someones lifen is if you are in a chat room talking to someone and you don't know who it is you have no way to know for sure who you are talking to. It could be a creepy adult or a murder and you'd be thinking that it is a cod kid that wants to be your friends and you could end up letting some information slip. He could ask you to meet him somewhere and they could endup taking you forever and during that time you were talking to him you could of been doing something else than talk to some stranger on the computer. My last thing I believe that bthe computer has an effect on people is that they won't be us active. they'd be lounging around all day on the computer instead of playing a sport or running around outside. Who cares if you colud get hand eye coordination you can play @NUM1 @CAPS1-box with your family and still it's because you get hand eye coordination and youre spending time with family. Even better than that you could be palying outside with your family it will keep you extremely more active than anything and you will be able to spend time with your family. Now that I told you aall of those reasons the computers effect you should know now that spending time off the computer is much more healthier than sitting on the computer all day."	1790	
1791	1	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine how life would be if we all stop sitting on our behinds on the computer all day but enjoying mother nature? The issue is that experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think we should give the computers a break so that we @CAPS1 get enough excercise, so we @CAPS1 enjoy nature, and so that we @CAPS1 keep our knowledge. I think that we should give the computer a break so that we @CAPS1 start excercising. Who wouldn't want to excersize to stay in shape. I remember when me and my mom used to exercise once a day so that we @CAPS1 stay in good shape. Surely if you go on the computer everyday instead of exercising you will start to gain weight. Who would want to gain weight? Why should a person not exercise and stay healthy? Another reason why we should give computers a break is so that people @CAPS1 enjoy nature. For example, they @CAPS1 go to the park or even ride their bikes. In @ORGANIZATION1 school @PERCENT1 say that they love to ride their bike instead of going on the computer. Why not go outside and smell the fresh air, or even go swimming at the beach? Another reason we should give the computer a break is so that we @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. For example if you stay on the computer and play games you will lose your focus on work. Why should your parents be worried because their kids grades are slowly decreasing and decreasing every second. Why should smart kids get low grades over playing games on their computers? So now I say ""I wont waste my knowledge ever again"". It's now or never! Should kids give the computer a break or not. I think they should because they wont get enough exercise, so that the kids @CAPS1 enjoy mother nature. Also so that they @CAPS1 keep their knowledge. This is why kids should to focusing on computers. So why not go waisting your time and knowledge on computers now!"	1791	
1792	1	"Dear newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help with education believe it or not. They let people keep in touch with each other no matter where they are. Also computers help people with so many useful things. Education is a very important thing in life. And computers are a big part of education. In my school we do many things on the computer like typing papers, research projects, and sometimes even rests. Computers dont only help with education in school but at our own homes too. When your surfing the web you might come across articles of people and places and that helps your education. The computer is also a good place to learn about history, you can find out about the worlds history or maybe even your own family history. Computers can teach people a lot. Computers can also be helpful for peoples health if you use them the right way. Instead of looking up silly stuff look up what foods you can eat that are good for you and what you can do to stay healthy. You can look up recipes that are healthy and delicous. On the computer you can get tons of other peoples opinions on ways to stay healthy which is better than just getting our opinion from somebody you know. Computers can also help you excercise. You can find out different types of excercises and stretches. You can even watch excercising videos and follow along with them. Its possible that you find a video or type of excercise that works good for you. Instead of searching things on the internet that are not useful look up something important like your health. Computers are useful in thousands of different ways. One way is keeping in touch with people. I keep in touch with my friends by using facebook, myspace, and aim. A lot of other people use these sites to. These sites also help me keep in touch with my family. I talk to cousins that live a city down from mine and even my family members that live across the country and in another continent. Computers are also not just for the important things in life there to have fun too. There are millions of websites with games, jokes, and funny videos. There are so many uses for a computer. In conclusion computers have a very positive effect on people. They help children and adults with there education and learning. The internet can also help people live healthy so they can have a happy life. There are so many different uses of a computer, you can do almost anything on it. Computers can defenitely have a positive effect on people."	1792	
1793	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 the caveman found fire, ever, thought what would happen if he did not use it? Well that is where we are today. The computer is our fire. Some people might not be able to compare a computer to fire, but the advancement in technology is just about the same. There are now tons of people who use computer. I definetly agree that we should continue the use of computers. Computers help people learn, we can communicate better, and it will allow us to advance farther. The computer can help us learn. It can teach us about faraway places that we probably would never have known that they existed. We can learn about the weather better. If we did not did not have computers we would have never left earth. Or be able to make @CAPS2. The computer has already helped us a math teacher, @PERSON1 said"" Computers have boosted the kids knowledge @CAPS5 much. I never learned some of the stuff @CAPS1 i was growing up. This next generation will be the we have had yet."" @CAPS3 more than we could have alone, @CAPS5 why get rid of it? The computer can also help us communicate better and faster. which the avoke in the @LOCATION2 happened, it might have taken a weck or even a month for the @LOCATION1 to hear about it, and longer to try and go down to help. By then the people would have to try and fix it. it up themselves for two months or more. I remember yesterday. I had a board of education meeting to go to. It was really importan checking my @CAPS4-mails on the computer and I found out that i needed to go. It was better that i found out and not the next day @CAPS1 my boss was going to yell at me because i did not go. That is how useful the computer is to communicate. The computer is also goind to help us @CAPS3 farther. It is like the fire. It helped People @CAPS3 @CAPS5 much, @CAPS5 once the computer is at its peak, it will push us just as for the fire did. Survey shows that @PERCENT1 of the children population is already smarter than the adult population. @CAPS5 @CAPS1 the children become adults there is nothing this world cannot do. we would be able to colonize the galaxy! @CAPS5, as you can see, computers are more beneficial than bad. they help teach people new stuff, communicate faster and better, and will help us @CAPS3 farther. Think about it, millions of years from now, people will say, ""@CAPS6 if man never made computers, that would be worse than the fall of empire."" @CAPS7 you for taking the time to read this letter."	1793	
1794	1	"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 now is a letter to explain to us all, that computers are not a major destroyer of society. They don't just make people exercise less, they don't just make people interact less with family. They help so much, and not many people can see that. Computers are a wonderful thing to society. They help people make friends, they help with giving information, and they make our lives easier. For a start, computers are good because they introduce us to new people. For example, if you are shy or socially awkward, you know it's very hard to make new friends. However, with a computer you won't feel as shy, which helps make friends easily! Another example is that if no one wants to be your friend for your appearance, then the computer can help. You can make friends without being seen by them which is a great thing if you are emoarressed or being stopped by your appearance. Computers help make friends in many more ways as well. Therefore, computers are a great thing for a society. They also provide us information. Another reason why computers are a nice thing for our society, is that they give us info. If you need help on some work or a project, for example, you can find almost anything from the computer. maybe you even want to study for a test; you can study on the computers. Also, you can learn about any place in the world. If you need information of a hotel, you just want to learn or if you want to know about something that happened there, it's all on the computer. Even if you just wont the news of one place, you can find it with the computer. Thus, makes the computer a fantastic item that helps the society. Besides info, they make our lives easier. As my final reason, computers benefit society by making our lives easier to handle. Such a way they do this is that make files easier to make and organize. When writing something it might have mistakes and be harder to read, but computers show your mistakes and have easy to read fonts. My next example in that when you have something in real life it is so easy to lose or misplace. On the other hand, computers store whatever you upload, so they cant be lost. Something as important as pictures can be saved by adding them to your computers. As you can see, computers help the lives of all. Now you can agree with me when I say. Computers have a huge effect on society. They show us new people. They consist of much helpful info. They make."	1794	
1795	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there has been some talk about how computers are changing our world for the better. Computers are apparently the only way their we will survive in the future. This is nonsense! Computers are taking away our valuable sleep hours, our rights to a good education, and our health! Computers are in fact the way of the unhealthy future. I ask you to go ahead a think about the time you spend on the computer. The average teen in the year @DATE1 spent @NUM1 hours a day on the computer. Now compare that to the amount of time you spent as keep. Chances are high that you only get @NUM1 or @NUM3 hours asleep making the amount of time you spent going on the web and the amount of beauty set you got about the same. That right there should tell you, that something is arong with the computer lifestyle. We all fall victim to drowsiness.. every once in a while is alright. However, for every hour you spend on the computer your are @PERCENT1 sleeper then you were! @CAPS5 is the price of losing energy worth @CAPS4? Did you know that millions of people wake up as early as they can just to be playing on the computer. Some wake up as early as @NUM4 in the morning! Forgive me if I'mmistaken but @NUM4 o'clock in the morning just to talk on facebook is breaching insanity. Sleep is important @CAPS5 playing on the computer isn't worth our @NUM6's. Not only is losing precious sleep bed but now the devil's invention is deleting our education from our now computer operated minds! Ask any student how much time they spend studying the answer will be I don't need to study. ""@CAPS2 that sound right. Kids do need to study they just want to chat with friends online. The average students grade went down @PERCENT2 list year because of all the time spent on the computer. Speaking of the ever trendy online chat..how many time have you heard lol, omg, or @CAPS3? Well one things for sure @CAPS4 in papers, worksheets, and just about anything that a computer kids hands in! Another issue is that kids who don't care about school are effecting the thought of those who do. One kid said ""@CAPS4's only cool to talk online school is for."" This is the wrong message to send kids! School is cool. Finally computers are throwing away our health. More and more people are getting diseases because they spend too much time in front of the screens @PERCENT2 more people got diabetes last year do to lack of exercise. Playing sports has been proven as away to make a child more well rounded. Computers do net, @CAPS5 don't we want to un-plug ourselves and live dive into sports? Sports will also make your mind more fit. They will teach you to work as a team and not give in to peer pressure. @CAPS5 as you can see computers are lending this world down a dark road. @CAPS4's time we say enough and become unplugged! Our life shouldn't be compermised for time spent on the computer. These inventions are giving us less beauty sleep, throwing our education in the recycling bin, and giving us a life with our health! Stop this injustice and unplug that computer!"	1795	
1796	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I would like to complain about the everyday use of computers. I believe that now in days the use of computers are being abused. Many people use the computer and doesn’t spend time with the family. The everyday use of computers is also causing certain people to gain access weight. Another reason is that by staring at the screen can create eye damage! As you knew my first complaint is how by being on the computer s much it takes away time spent with family and friends. Most of the day you are on the computer gives no room for family time. So that for one is not a great thing. My second reason people shouldn't be on the computer so much is because it's causing people to gain access weight. By just sitting on the computer all day you get no exercise whatsoever, so you gain weight not wanted. The only thing your body that gets exercise while on the computer is your fingers. Also the human body needs exercise! My final reason that the computer shouldn't be in so much use is because it can cause eye damage. When your eyes look at the screen for a long period of time, they tend to strain. So this can cause your next trip to the eye doctor. Well I have explained all my reasons to you and I hope you understand. Computers are fun but you got to give them a rest sometimes unless you want to lose time with the family, gain weight, or maybe your next trip to the eye doctor then you might want to turn it off and go jogging, or camping with the family! Thank you for taking time off your schedule to read my complaints!"	1796	
1797	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 having kids wasting there whole lives by being on the computer to much. I sure wouldn’t want my son to be like that. Being on the computer too much can make you unhealthy from not exercising, not be able to enjoy nature, and keep you away from you friends and family. Not much good can came out of being on the computer @NUM1. Please newspaper take my word. @CAPS4 will make you well known @CAPS3 you agree with me on this. First of all, being on the computer all day, everyday can make you unhealthy by not exercising. @PERCENT2 of people that do not exercise live less longer to the people that do exercise. Times @CAPS2 said. “@CAPS3 you spend your life on the computer and don’t take a jog once in a while. Then @CAPS4 can hurt you body in a days, and way.” I believe that quote the @PERCENT1 @CAPS5. @PERSON2 stated to me, “@CAPS3 you can’t get off the computer, @CAPS4 can hurt your body badly and can make you less athletic because you are so used & not exercising, “@CAPS3 doctor said that you should believe @CAPS4 trust me this will be a great decision. You will see improvements everyday. Second of all. You won’t be to enjoy nature @CAPS3 you are on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of students that don’t get some fresh air once in a while can make them less with the worth. @CAPS5 @PERSON1 said, “ @CAPS3 you don’t pay attention to nature, then you won’t know anything about the earth and what have gone on “ that will not be helpful in your social studies class. Peoples @CAPS2 use said. “@CAPS7 on the computer and not enjoying the outdoors can actually make you less smarter on what you do. “I have even heard that same qoute from doctors, too my friend. Dive was a straight A student and very popular. He is a very tall and handsome kid. Then all of the sudden, one day he met a computer and invite sports and never went outside and @CAPS4 change him a lot. I would never want that to happen to me or any of my friends again. The is do you want to happen to you? Lastly computers can less interaction with friends and family. @PERCENT4 of students that still on the computer become less close with friends and even family. That is not a good thing at all. @CAPS5 @PERSON3 said, ""computer only cause mental and less interactions with friends & family at school. “@CAPS4 is very interesting that people still use computers after all of those reasons. The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 newspaper said, “computers decreasing bond of family and friends. “I agree with that statement the whole one yards. @CAPS4 is just very sad how people waste their lives doing same thing that is not good for them. Please make the next choice or @CAPS4 will be to late. To sum @CAPS4 all us. @CAPS1 children outside and could better. That can happen @CAPS3 you make the decision I am changing right now. @CAPS3 you don’t @CAPS4 can keep them from exercising, enjoying outdoors and nature, and interacting with family and friends. No one wants that, so please read my carefully newspaper make the decision and make @CAPS4 right."	1797	
1798	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 should think that computers are a good thing because this technology help people everyday in many different ways. Computers can allow you to have fun playing games, do research for work, @CAPS4 new people, and many businesses are built around computers. Lets think about how a computer can effect @CAPS3's life. A man or women goes to work and then goes to the computer. Well maybe this man is a scientist who is using the computer to save findings, help research new ones, and make calculations, @CAPS5 job depends on computers to discover new findings. The man might be a person who answers @NUM1 calls. @CAPS5 computer can help save lives by telling them where the person in need is calling from and how to get there. So these machines are powerful work resourses. Computers can also entertain people when they get bored. It is just like any other video game, you get to go online and play with friends or make new friends in the proses. If a person is bored and has nothing to do then they can hop on a computers go to a website or put in a @CAPS6 and play many fun games. It is a good way to learn and entertain in your free time. People will alway learn from computers. You can find interesting facts, how to build things or just about anything you can think of will be on the computer. Besides many schools use computers to help educate their students by using interactive game that aid many kids into learning more can just teach them in general. The people will always think for themselves and most will not give their computer just because someone says that it is bad for them. I have opened up to the people to try to convince them that computers are not us but they are doing quite the opposite and are helping us in everyday life. They help us Learn, have fun, and some people even depend on them to make a living. Thank You."	1798	
1799	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, Computers, and other technology are very popular today. Many people look at computers saying well they are innapropriete the way children and young adults are using them. Well, those are only the negatives of computers there are many positive things in having a computer. Starting off with Online @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, learning about faraway places. Lastly, chatting online with family or friends. First off, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and online learning sites are populating more and more to this day. If our society didn't have online toutering or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 students wouldn't be able to learn up to their fullest potential. If a high amount of society didn't believe in online activities now would we as students get the knowledge we have now. Also, this online @CAPS2 is an opportunity for students to learn by themselves & classes that their school @MONTH1 not offer. If someone were to ever to take that away we would not be where we are today in this world because we would not have those people who went above and beyond in their learning due to society. Next, online chat is really big throughout our nation. This is an opportunity to talk with family members that live faraway. Also this is an opportunity to hook up with your old friends who @MONTH1 have moved away. About @PERCENT1 of our world looks at online chatrooms as being a bad influence on children when really the problem is the parents letting their (son/daughter) child use online chatroom who are immature. Lastly, online is a world to explore throughout. Just like the world we live in. You can go online and research any topic you want to such as culture through out our world. Different countries have different cultures and you can learn about them online. Also, you can find different attractions to different countries, states, counties and towns as well as book tours and go on trips to these places. Such as china you can start off by researching that country then you can go visit that country and see what you missed. There are many reasons to look at computers in a bad manor. I can see how: because people are taking advantage of technology and not using their own so it is brainwashing people and making @PERCENT2 of the people that use computer think one day nobody will live without using computers. There are many good reasons too have a computer. One is to advance your knowledge as far as you can. So why don't our society do so. And look at computer to @CAPS4 with peoples lives."	1799	
1800	1	"Why people should use computers? Computers are good for people because you have something else to do while your learning things you don't know. One of the reasons why computers are good for people is because, family, friends around the world, like if your in other country and you can't see your family or friends you will just go on the computer and video chat with them, if you wanna keep in touch with people that you know for a long time the computer could keep them intouch, if you miss someone and you dont have a phone the computer might be a great idea. Also it helps you on questions that you have, if you don't know a word you can go on @ORGANIZATION1 and you will find the defenition if the teachers gives you homework and its very hard and you can't find the answer on the book the computer have all the answers you need, if your friends say something about any subject and you have no idea what are they talking about you could go look it up and learn something new in life. In the computer you could see things before anyone does, like you could whatch videos over and over again to see what real happend. It give you the real apportunity to learn something new that you will remember all your life, but computers are not use all the time you could spend sometime outside and have fun also. Computers are good for you and help you in your homework or in things you don't know, and getting in touch with people you wanna see/talk, the computers are a lot of fun, but also spending time outside with other people could be very nice too."	1800	
1801	1	"@CAPS1, its time for supper! "@CAPS2 on, mom I have to update my facebook!" @CAPS3, times you as a reader, @MONTH1 have found yourself in a similar situation. Couped up in your basement updating friends spaces and playing games on your computer. You probably havent seen the sun in a few weeks, either. @CAPS3 argue this is bad because computers are addictive and restrict exersising, enjoying nature and social events such as family and friends. But is @CAPS9 really allthat bad? For instance, you can chat with people accross the globe, send and receive messages at breakreck speed, and learn things about farway places like the @ORGANIZATION5. this is where I stand on this contreversal debate. @CAPS6, @CAPS4 possibly the biggest thing since electricity. There are billions. No, @CAPS5 things to do on the @CAPS6 more other are being made each @CAPS14. Wether @CAPS9 be a fan site for people like @CAPS7.J sandwiches or a viral site such as @CAPS8 or myspace. And while @CAPS9 is addiding, @CAPS9 has @CAPS3 upsides to @CAPS9. @CAPS6 games help with hand-eye coordinating and @CAPS20 your ever sluck on homework. The @CAPS6 will teach you. This is only a small reason why computers are a good thing. @CAPS21 what @CAPS20 your computer doesn't support @CAPS6? what @CAPS9 good for? Nothing right? WRONG! The computer has installed apps such as the brain bending @CAPS10 sweeper, or the reaction testing pinball. Also, you can always install games like the @ORGANIZATION6 (real-time-strategy) @CAPS11, @ORGANIZATION2. this is on @ORGANIZATION3 the games, along with @ORGANIZATION3, and @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS12 that tasts how well your headership skills are along with money management, and planning. Furthermore, by buying old arcade games you can get to see what gaming was like "@CAPS13 in the @CAPS14". You can play old games such as @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION4, and @CAPS18-@CAPS19. @CAPS21 why is @CAPS9 @CAPS21 bad ? Hear this: (quote @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1) "@CAPS20 one is to stay on is to stay on the computer for @NUM1 hours a @CAPS14 for @NUM2 weeks, gain about @NUM3 pounds each week following." @CAPS21 yes. you should limit your computer time. but did you know that @NUM4 out @ORGANIZATION3 @NUM5 people who are on the computer for @NUM6 hours a @CAPS14 also gain increase in skills such as typing speed, knowledge coordination. This is @CAPS22. @CAPS21, @CAPS23, is @CAPS9 really that bad? To sum @CAPS9 @CAPS23 up. Computers are a good thing. Furthermore, you can exceed life skills such as planning, and money management. Also, you can have an aspect @ORGANIZATION3 what gaming was like @CAPS13 then white @CAPS9 is @CAPS24 to get to know your world and the people in @CAPS9, you should your computer time to @NUM5-4 hours a @CAPS14 which reminds me @ORGANIZATION3 the time that a person @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS25.K for @NUM3 hours streight. @CAPS24, but not a good @CAPS26. @CAPS21 go get a computer and @CAPS27!"	1801	
1802	1	"Dear local newspaper: I am writing this letter to tell you I think computers have a positive effect on people that they benifit in the society. I as a single person think computers benifit the society because they give people the ability to learn about faraway places, can let people talk and chat onlines with other people and can help with education. Now on to making sure you agree with me. First compouts can give people the ability to learn interesting facts on neat stuff about very faraway places that you have never ever herd of befor. For example once I had to do a movie on a forgive country that I knew nothing about so what did I do? I want to the computers. Thier I found many fact and data about the place. Now if I can do that you can to and it will be very quick and very easy. Secondly you can talk to people or live chat with people even if their miles away. Their is many different sites and places to chat too. Like me I go and talk to my friends on @CAPS1, or myspace oncwe in a while. Also lets say you haven'ts seen a relative in a while you realy want to see them. But its allmost impossible to well not anymore."	1802	
1803	1	"Effects of computers @CAPS1 local newspaper, Have you ever realized @CAPS7 computers effect you and the people around you? well, I think the effects come in a bad way. for example, you could get abducted from strangers online, your grades would slip, and you wouldnt be able to live you life like a kid or adult anymore. @CAPS7, you will see my first explanation. First, you could get abducted from strangers online. When you're in the chat rooms, where you shouldn't be in the first place, kids and adults tend to talk to strangers. then they start telling them where they live, when puts both you and your family in jeapordy. This way, you shouldn't stay on the computer for a long time, because then you would be tempted to talk in chat rooms. Here is my next reason. Next, your grades would slip. When you get home, all you think about is, ""@CAPS2's new on facebook."" @CAPS3, ""@CAPS2 can I buy @CAPS7, this isn't healthy. You should be doing your homework when you get home. @CAPS3, adults should be worrying about bills, not about the email they just got, @CAPS5 time flys when you're on the computer, theres no way anyone will have time to do anything. @CAPS3, when you're at school or work, all you can think about is going home playing that new game on you computer. How are you suppost to concentrate on anything once you have that on you mind. Here's my last reason, @CAPS6, you wouldn't be able to live you life like an adult or child anymore. When you're a kid, you usually like playing outside, or playing with your pets, friends, and family. Well, when you spend most of your time on the computer, how are you going to burn calories, and run around by getting you energy out. You might even be a bad influence on you brother and sister. Without any exercise isn't good for your body. for adults, they wouldn't have time to pay for bills or spend time with their family. The kids would have no father figure to talk to or a mom to disguse their problems, @CAPS7 you will see all of my reasoning. In conclusion, computers control you life. I think they are truly just a device to make you loose control of you life. You could get abducted, you grades could slip, and you wouldn't be able to live your life. As you can see they inform but control."	1803	
1804	1	"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 is an issue on where technology benefical to our society. @CAPS1 are many ways people could benefit from new and advanced technology, and @CAPS1 ways people cannot. In this letter, I will be describing to you, the type of ways people can benefit from technology. First of all, computers give students and adults a chance of having an education. For example, if a young girl has a child and can't afford to stay in school, online classes gives them the chance to care for their child and still receive an education. If an adult a degree online will help them achieve. People need, technology offer, to give it. Secondly, some people are that if someone is always online, they will and see. He for what it is. Have you thought the flip side of that will computers, people can still explore the world. You can work. Finally, computer help families stay in touch. Computers are a great way for people to stay communicated. For example, maybe your phone isnt working properly or maybe not even working at all and you want to contact a friend or relative, you can easily go online with chat or webcam, etc to keep them notified on anything important or just to say hello. Wouldn't you want to still to communicate with too? In conclusion, Technology is advancing more and more, all the time. It's only getting better. Online classes, exploration of the world, and communicating with fellow people are just some of the things technology can do. Wouldn't you want to experience some of the things it can do?"	1804	
1805	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Advances in technology can ruin the future of our children. A computer, a thing that most people have although it comes with very good things about it there is also a lot of negative things. A couple examples are people can become addicted to the computer. So they stay all up in their house, in their room, where their computer is. Another reason is the dangers of computers. With technology advancing the internet is very dangerous and you have to be careful what information you give out. And at last cyber bullies just like actually bullies but instead of physically hurting someone cyber bullies mentally and emotionally take someone down and hurt them. As you can see these are only a few reasons why technology is becoming dangerous thing and has a negative effect on people and their life. Physical exercise is a good thing, it is needed if you want to stay and be a healthy person. But you can't get out go for a run and get physical exercise if your on the computer doing whatever you do. So the computer is haveing a negative affect on people because they arent getting at side and enjoying the fresh air. Instead they are inside on the computer. Alot of people are gamers so they could be all caught up in a whole different. That's a bad thing. It's bad becasue some people get so addicted to a game they gte addicted and maybe even. So if you obssesed with something your go to do it all the time, so when your inside being obsseses with whatever your obssesed to stay healthy. There are many dangers on the computer. For example petifiles. Petifiles are always on the for young kids they. Petifies disguse themselves as most likely teenagers or people on their @NUM1's and they tride kids into meeting or with them so the kids think they're meeting up with a person they thaght the petifile is but really they are just doing in a trap and could end up in a very dangerous serious situation that could end up death or go missing and never seen again. And dangerous thing on the internet is atlkers. This world isnt a safe the world is a cold and deciving place they is filled with people who will hate you and people who are crazy. So you have to be carefull on what kind of information you put out on the internet because you never know you could be stalked and that's another very dangerous situation. The last reason I'm going to mention is cyber bullies some might say are almost worse than actual bullies because cyber bullies mentally attack you and hurt you instead of physically. They are very mean people who will do whatever it takes to take somebody down. An example of a bad ending to cyber buling was there was a kid. I knew his name was @PERSON1.Everybody thaght he was gay because he didnt football as a summer so this buly went on @CAPS1 and started argue called @PERSON1 he is a gav fog and everybody and wrote mean comments about him and @PERSON1 got bullied so much couldnt like it anywhere and locked and hung himself and his mom found the next morning dead hanging in his closet. So as you can see their are many reasons why advance in technology isnt a good thing because many things even now have a bad turnout."	1805	
1806	1	"Dear newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on if I think computers are good or bad. Well computers are becoming well known in society we can buy laptops, desktops, phones that can go on internet.t.v.s gaming systems. I do think that this could have an affect on kids not going ouside as much and not getting exercise and seeing nature, I do belive though technology is a big part of life as we get older all our jobs deal with using computers such as a banker, ultrasonagrapher, teacher. To be prepared for jobs in our upcoming futres students should be well known to a computer and know how to use it. They shoud be able to know how to do presentations with there computers type well without looking and set documents into folders. Although I think the kids should be using computers and have a computer class in school. It doesn't mean that they will always be on a computer. School has a big part of getting students to go outside, exercise. They are able to get that during gym and wehn weathers nicer they are able to go outside and do activities. The kids can also join school sports team and sports teams outside of school. Besides getting exercise they can also comunicate with people across the world this benifits from learning different people cultures. I comepletly think that technology will benefit people for life and it will have a positive outcome on them, I hope you can too."	1806	
1807	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I do agree that to many people spend there time on the computers. In my opinion first I think they do because less time enjoying nature. Secondly, not enough time exercising. Also, there not interacting with family and friends @CAPS1 writing to urge you that to many people spend time on the computers. I hope you will agree with what @CAPS1 saying as you read on. As you can see many people spend alot of time on the computer but less time enjoying nature. For instance, you can go around help the community, help the homeless you can also have a day to your self go get some fresh air and take a walk. If I was oyu this is what I would do. Secondly, they spend to much time on the computers because they are not interacting with they family and friends. For example, I like to spend time with my family and friends. We go out to eat, the mall, we even sometimes just play the games together to have fun. Just like they should want to en joy being with there family and friends, you will have an closer relationship by doin that instead of being on the computer all day. Lastly, they spend to much time on the computers because they have less time exercising. In contrast like now we have alot of over weight teens. They rather be on the computer instead of going to a gym and exercise. I always try to exercise at home or when I'm playing basketball I do alot of running. If you ask me I believe exercising is better for you the sittin on the computer all day. In conclusion, as you can see less time enjoying nature, interacting with family and friends, and less time exercising. Is better for you than being on the computer being lazy. I hope that you will understand the way I am feeling about this situation."	1807	
1808	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard about people's opinions on computers and I thought I should share my thoughts on what I think being a person who spends an hour on the computer a day, I completley understand what people say when they say computers can be a distractment @MONEY1 your life. But I do not agree with this. There ore some positive things about computers. Some people in the world can not find jobs. Some people in the world have amazing talents and they are not discovered it. This is where websites like youtube.com come into play. People who are musically talented sometimes set discovered in youtube, and then in a flash they are making @MONEY1 a year. If the world did not have computers, very talented singers would not be where they are today. You tube is not the only website that is changing. Facebook.com can help you re-connect with the people to lost touch with. I was reading a magazine one day and I read about a girl who lost touch with her biological brother and found him so facebook. Sometimes computers can bring people together, and that is definetly not a bad thing. Have you ever gotten sick @MONEY1 your life and wanted to go on a nice vacation? I bet @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 readers in this paper would say that in some days, they would not mind a great escape. Computers can help you research far away places so you know where you would be going computers can give up the information you need so you will know anything and everything about where you are headed. Some people @MONTH1 beleve that computers are not necessary because instead @MONEY1 being online, you could be excersising or doing anything else to improve your health. I think people should still have computer acess, but limit the amount @MONEY1 time they spend on it a day. If people did not spend all their time online, I am sure people would not feel on issue about computers. In conclusion, computers are actually pretty they can help you and jobs, re-connect with friends and family, and look up places you are wanting to go. But also, people should be living their lives. Limit yourself on the computer thats something we can do right?"	1808	
1809	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have an extremely bad effect on the people of society. Instead of getting stuck on the computer all day, we could start excersing and losing weight. We could also go to a soup kitchen and give out meals. Finally, we could save the environment from all of the electricity we use. It would benefit not only yourself, but others as well, if we did theese things.. To start, I would suggest that people stop spending so much time on the computer, and join a gym. I mean, who would want to be the one to be at home, bored, on the computer? You could be having so much more fun with your friends on the treadmill. @PERSON1 @CAPS2 from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, states, ""The key to losing weight, is to be motivated and have fun."" You can't do that on the computer. Eating right can also impact how much weight you lose. You could learn where to eat right by going to a soup kitchen. First of all, going to a soup kitchen would help many people who need food and nutrition. I remember a time when I was going to a soup kitchen with my church. I definately didnt want to go, but, I had to. Once I got there, I really started to enjoy it. Another reason you should go to a soup kitchen, is to meet new people. It would help you to get to know them and be friendly. The most important thing to hungry people to love. If you went to a soup kitchen, you could give them that and fresher air by riding on a bike. I firmly think that going on a bike would help the environment as well as if we all turned off our computers. Studies show we use about @NUM1 kilowatts of energy a week. I we shut off our computers for only one week, it would bring that number down to @NUM2 kilowatts. I feel that the environment is an important part of the world and that we need to take care of it. If we do, it will last a lot longer. By using the computer less, there will be less polution. We won't have to waste our world or be selfish for unimportant things. In conclusion we should go to a soup kitchen excersize and turn off the computers. They are a very bad influence on america. Computers have to much of a bad effect on society."	1809	
1810	1	"Although some people believe computers aren't very usefull, you'll see why they are benefits to the society. Friends and family can keep it touch. Computers are very helpful with school, work, and projects. They also help test harmful, dangerous or tricky experiments. I know tons of people who are only able to keep in touch with faraway friends or family by using computers. For example, my friend that lives here in @LOCATION1, keeps in touch with his grandmother and grandfather that lives in @LOCATION2, by using the video chat on his computer. This allows him not only to talk to his grandparents, but to see them as well! Computers also help friends to keep it touch with websites like, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. The websites aren't harmful, but helpful. Friends love to use the websites to keep in touch with friends and family. Computers are also very helpful with schools, work, etc. I always use my computer when I have a project in school that I need some help on. Everyone uses computers when they would like acurate data. Computers are easier to find information for a book, and information is posted everyday. Which just shows how computers are much more up to date then books are. I'm not just saying this. This can be proven. As well as, typing up a project and printing it out for school, work, etc., is a lot neater and with the ability to spell check, gramer check, etc, on computers. You will have less mistakes on a project when you use a computer. Now, for me last opinion on computers. How would harmful chemical testing be without computers? How could we be sure our cars are running fine, and are safe to be in without computers? There are so many things that we depend on a computer to tell us is safe. Computers also help us design cars, buildings, etc. For example, say engineers are try to make a new small compact car that is safe enough to protect the drives in a @NUM1 car crash. Are the engineers going to make tons of different cars, put people in them and crash into a wall going @NUM1? No! We have the to test it on computer. Clearly, we must rethink the way we look at computers. They were made to help us. I told you how they help friends and family keep in touch from long distances I also told you how they can help you with school, work, projects, chemical testing, car testing, etc. Computers are made to help us and they always will. I see nothing wrong with the creation of computers, everyone uses it. "	1810	
1811	1	"Computors are looked at as either friend or foe. I see computors and technoledges as friends not an enemy to battle against! Without the computor keeping in touch with people would be limited greatley. In schools computors help us learn different open our world so we are not just limited to places close by that people have told us about. They are truly magnificent! My best friend is moving to @LOCATION1 in two years. When she does I will have to keep in touch with her mainly by computor. Email is not only cheaper but quicker than mail. And like my friend, someone you know might live in a diferent time zone and making calls could be difficult. Computors don't only allow you to keep in touch with distant friends and reletives but also people close to you. Everyone has a scheduaule, they are a part of everyday life. Finding the time to talk to someone is difficult expesualy when their schedual never seems to match yours. You don't want to lose the freindship or cut your ties so what do you do? Email then when you can via the computor! You have time then and there and don't know when you'll have some again. That makes mailing somthing quite difficult. Life is basicly one giant schedual with empty slots for 'you' time. In this 'you' time there are many things you can do. For example, go online and look up interesting places to go around your area. After using some of your 'you' times for research you can take a day off and go somewhere as a reward for all your hard research. Things like this are very hard without the computor. You would only be able to go places you knew or heard of. Computors help you and different places with more information then you could get from one or two people. They do more than just look up places and information to make plans for just you, you could do a double team and go some place with two people who both information from their computors. Or have a whole look up information and plans for a group outing of family or your closest friends. Besides keeping in touch or making plans computors can teach you. How many times have you needed to know somthing and looked it up on the computor? You can find online dictionarys and translators for free! I've often used the computor to translate @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 to @CAPS1 for projects that we arn't expected to know words on. Working men and woman so online to go back to school while still working full time. My mom does that to set in working with preschoolers! My sister has used to the computor to look up information about colleges as she is going soon. Can't you see that computors arn't out to kill society? They are here to help you keep in touch with your greatly missed family and friends in far off places! To help you make plans for some rightly earned 'you' time, 'friend' time, and 'family' time! To give you a chance at a better job helping you learn! Can you see now how computors are here for help? Sure people missuse them but that can easily be prevented by parents keeping a close eye on their children and adults watching ther time closley."	1811	
1812	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I am writing to you today to inform you, my opinion on the effect that computers has on people. I belive hthat computers has a benefial effect on people, because its up to date technology can help you learn things faster. Also, you can talk with people online all around the world, and even reconnect with old friends. Finally, computers allow you to find stuff out now faster, like sports stats and news storys. I dont know any other faster researcher ther a computer. Its like you can search for anything and find an answer for it. You can search for a recipe or baked ahska and you can actually get it in a matter of seconds. Instead of goin to the book store and buying a whole @NUM1 doller book on it. A computer is like having a book store in your living room. Also lets say your a college student studying for your mid-term, and you left your books at school, you can just go on the computer and search for what you need to study on. And bamm! There it is right in your eyes! Okay, so lets say your in school right, and your dad gets a job and you to have move far away. You don't have to worry about loseing your old friends, and contact with them. If you have a computer, you can chat with your friends anywhere. I mean like c'mon how cool is that! Your in @STATE1 chatting with your old friends back in new york! Thats pretty awesome. Also, lets say you where in high school and you and your high school sweet heart, where going strong and she away. Through the magic of the internet you can reconnect with that person and ones! Finally, your business man, and your jammed up at work with alot of meetings. You dont have time to go home and check the news. You can just go on your computer and check it from the office. You can watch the news and still have time for your @NUM2 o clock brunch, because you dident go home to see something you could in your office. Thats the beauty of it. Big sports fan, but stuck out at work and cant see the big game. But wait your bummed out for nothing because the game is at a click of a button if you watch it on your computer! You never have to miss the game again! In conclusion, i think the computer is a beniefial for people because, you can learn things way faster on it. Also because, you can chat and reconnect with old and new people. And last because, you can check the news and sports without having to leave the office!"	1812	
1814	1	"Dear news paper, Computers are good for people in many ways. They help us learn, just the way in school. They are helping us to learn more the just because some people don't like them doesnt mean shouldn't. After all, it is our lives. @CAPS1 do kids pay attention in school. But @CAPS1 we use the computer that's more we can learn. We can learn how to use the webcam to interact with our friends on the computer. We can do research to look up things that we do for school. Instead of learning something in school, and about it. We can read, and see a picture on video to understand it more. Computers teach us how to use more machines. We don't know what is going to be made? in the culture on how had they are going to be to use. So isn't it better if we know how to use them now? Some people don't even know how to use computer, or even cell phones. But @CAPS1 we get other cuture, that maybe a big problem. Just because some people spend all their time on the computers and don't do other things. doesn't mean we all do. I only go on the computer @CAPS1 I'm about to go to bed. But i'm out side, all day, I @CAPS2 do things with my family. So if some people have problems with computers, doesn't mean that we all do and to face the problems toward that so as I told you, computers, help us learn more thing in and even things for school. They teach us how to use things don't know gonna be in the just because some people are lazy doesnt mean we all are and have to deal with the people that do. So we should be able to use the computer without haging to deal people complaints. It is our lives."	1814

Ther re positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letteing people communicate with family or friends from across the world or letting everything be easy to find what they @CAPS4 many people are people isolate and keeping them from talking to family / friends I is helping them by being to chat or type to them. People can now talk to reltives in the comfort of thre home without having to about how they look. Computer also phone bills because of call your mom in @LOCATION1 just go on I chat and chat with her, it's just @CAPS5 you can see the computers Some people also think computers give people to much access to but ther it give people the of know what they This is good for school to for look for In my fall @NUM1. or people @CAPS6 you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that @CAPS7 computers without or keeping people away from family"	1815	
1816	1	"Dear Newspaper. I @CAPS2 that people are spending to much time on computer. They are hurting their eyes, gaining weight, and they aren't giveing the @CAPS1 what it needs. When you stare at a computer scren your eyes cant regenerate from the brightness & all the words & pictures. Your eyes shouldn't nbe punished like this they didn't hurt you, why do you want to hurt them? @CAPS5 always told that if I stare at something for a length of time @CAPS3 eyes wont readjust to their normal self because of straining themself for so long. I realy don't @CAPS2 all of you stareing at a computer want problems. Many people who just sit around are gaining weight, and you wonder why? Maybe its bevause your not out & moving around. When you eat you gain fat cells, callories, nutrients, and alot more. But when you gain those things from the food, your body needs to prove around to help break sitting still only tells the @CAPS1 do stop and hold everything there. To break all of the things down your body needs to be moving around I dont know about you people but I try @CAPS3 best to give thing it needs to maybe this will convince you! The @CAPS1 is the most important thing in your body. You need to make sure it's getting every thing it needs maybe you @CAPS2 you are healthy but your @CAPS1 needs fresh air and nutrients from the food. Sitting in a chair or laying down does not help anything at all. I used to do the same thing a while me that if I kept sitting I playin on the computer, @CAPS3 body wont be able to work or even worse. HEART @CAPS4 or seasons. Hopefully you will listen to @CAPS3 warning, maybe people will start choosing to leave the computer & go have fun and exercise. Reasons why being on the computer too much is bad for you are that your eyes have a really hard time working. Plus your gaining weight without even knowing and your @CAPS1 needs to be taken care of needs things that you cant get from the computer all the time. So please listen to what @CAPS5 saying. It realy if important that you take care of yourself."	1816	
1817	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have bad effects on people, and heres why: they get less exercise, become less social with family and friends, and it is dangerous in many ways. To start, people will most likely get less exercise if they go on the computer often. For example, if you sit in front of your computer monitor all day, chances are you are going to be less prone to wanting to exercise. Also, the outdoors might not compare to what fun you can have on the computer. And lastly, people can get addicted to games that have many levels: @CAPS1 is even a website called addictinggames.com! People might not even leave the computer to get let alone get exercise. As previously stated, computers can promote bad and exercise habits, which can lead to overall bad health. Next, people can become less social due to computers. For instance, you are probably going to end up in your house like a if you go on the computer frequently. And, chances are, you're not going to want to pay attention to your cell phone if someone is trying to text or call you. That can lead to very unsocial behavior. And last, the computer could become your life. Never leaving the monitor, never going outside, and never attending social events you don't want that to happen, do you? As recently said, computers can and will promote unsocial behavior. Finally, @CAPS1 is the dangerous side of computer use. Facebook, myspace & aim people can talk to you and friend request you, and you might say no, and might say yes, but strangers can always contact you either way. People @MONTH1 not know this but if you have a facebook account for long enough, people can look up your first and last name on google and see your profile picture. Its very scary! And to finish, a lot of people these days dont know how to be safe on the computer. They'll accept a friend request even if they dont know the person as previously stated, the computer has a very and dangerous side. To sum it all up, computers promote bad fitness, a bad social life, and it is very dangerous. You wouldnt want that for the people of our town, would you?"	1817	
1818	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I got to @ORGANIZATION1 at @CAPS5 society @ORGANIZATION1. Im at @NUM1 year old girl in the @NUM2 grade. Ive benn thinking a lot about how a lot of people who goes on the computer every single day with out doing anything interactive like playing outside with theri friends or having fun with theri families. Alot of people have probably been going on the computer so much that their addicted. ""@CAPS6"" taht is the sound of someone typing on a key board for a computer. Some people all around the world have been hooked going on computer so much that they are becoming lazy and they relly do anything to be active. Like playing a sport or even having a hobbie. I believe the most people who go on the computers the most are teens because they chatsites like @CAPS7 or @CAPS8. I go on such as @CAPS2 but I don't go on them all the time. I know going on the computer is too because you can go on it for homewroks or for projects to look something You can get pictures of someone or soemthing that your researching or type an essay. You can also you in contact with your family on online talking. Computers do teach hand-eye coordiantion because alot of students around the world have had the ability to learn about far away places before. I do believe that computer and negative effect. They say teens spends so much time But what if their homeworks and talking Their are alot of education websites for children do for . effecting on people. Like what in theri something . Some people can . So I think does benefits society if someone thinks not good that ."	1818	
1819	1	"Dear local newspaper, I understand that people are trying to deside whether or not being on computers is a good thing or a bad thing, and I think that this will help them make their decisions. I think that too much computer is a very bad thing because if people are sitting by their computer all day then they are not getting any exersize. And they are not enjoying nature out in the sun with their friends. One reason why too much computer is a bad thing is that people who sit on their computer all day can not get the exersize that they should be getting. Take my friend @PERSON3 for example, @PERSON3 never had a computer in his house before, he joined all of the clubs at school him and I were on the basketball team and we got a good amount of exersize every day. Now that his parents decided to buy him a computer, he quit all of his clubs and the basketball team, and now he is going obese. He is gaining many pounds every day. But @PERSON3 is not the only one with that problem. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 who are overweight are this fat because they sat by their computer all day. @PERSON1, physical tharapist has met with many obese people and talked about their problem she found out that almost all of them are obese because they do not get enough exersize because they are on the computer too much. Another reason why too much computer is bad is because they are not enjoying nature. Take my friend @PERSON2 for example, she was a great person who loved nature. But when she got her own laptop. She doesnt like to be outside anymore. I asked her if the counted to come to the nature with me and she said that she has a vertual park. on her computer. I tried to tell her that it was not as good as real nature but she said it was better. @PERSON2 isnt the only one with this problem. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 lack nature in their lines if they have a computer. Would you realy only want @CAPS1 to sit at home on their computers rather then enjoy nature? These reasons are why I think that people are getting way too much computer time, they are not getting enough exersise and they are not in the nature with friends enough."	1819	
1820	1	"People are or not computers benefit society. Some say that computers are an advancement on technology. I believe that computers are a most of time. People are spending more line on the computer than with family in members and friends. They are spending more time on the computer than exercising, and are not enjoying nature. Computers we just way people to become lazy. When computers out they because for more people to spend their family members and friends. Instead of playing a board games with their family kids and adults just go on the computer to play a game. Computers take away people can be spending with their friends. Now all people do is spend time talking to their friends online instead of playing outside. spending time with this people spend time with family members and friends because of . Researchers say that computers away from the time could be people on the . people the computer typing or playing . There now have jobs computer. Thus can people good . Enjoying a big of peoples lives along. Now you can just nature online rather than going outside and a pictures computers the ability to out pictures. People spend more time on the computer than outside. Nature to people . They would be on the computer. Computers are a big time. Any thing you finding computer you could find somewhere else. Computers away people. Spending time with and enjoying nature"	1820	
1821	1	"Dear Newspaper, I realize that you are going to make an article on using computers. I personally disagree with the statement that computers are good for you. People are spending too much time on their computers. Internet safty issues, the effecs of computer. My first reason is that people are spending way too much time on computers I know many friends that spend about half the day @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Satistics show that one out of every @NUM1 child in the @LOCATION1 is spending at least @NUM1 hours everyday on the computer. That's a lot of kids that show there time on the computer. They could be doing many other things during their time. They could be hanging out with frends at the mall or go to another friends because they could be doing fun activities with their parens and siblings. Also insted of sitting around and not doing anything the entire day the person could so ours and play sports like tennis, soccer and other fun athletic spends. If kids would exercise more in the @LOCATION2 we wouldn't have as many fur people as he. Another reason is the problem with internet safty. For example if you have an embarrasing of yourself from @CAPS3 grade and of your friends find it. He or she might post it on his or her facebook account. Then a school bully might see it and starts to tell other kids in your schoool about it through facebook. Those people might start your at school because of it. Another example is that you @MONTH1 have had a bad day in school an freinds, but then you friends stand insalty you. My final reuson is that using a computer for the work could change the you. If you use a computer for a certain amount of time for the right reasons that might be good for your grade, but if you are playing games and with the time of doing your homework or studying your grade with drop. That could effect your future. I think parents should monitor the actions children are taking online because you could prevent child for a grade class. If the parens have set a schedule where the  kidcould have a certan amount of time games or chat online their would be. I think that computers are not good for our society, People spend too much time on the computer. Instance of doing other things you never know what could be happen. Online games using a computer to play games too much might effect your grade. You should tell parent to computer use."	1821	
1822	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 how things work @CAPS1, I am writing a local letter I agree that technology @CAPS4 useful because without technology there @CAPS4 no way we can email or talk or text. Take a phone for an example A phone @CAPS4 good. It has technology and you can text. That @CAPS4 talking to @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @MONTH1 occur. The effects of technology @CAPS4 that technology @CAPS4 way more handson network and that means that technology, you can email faster than have to type up all the hard work and so when you can do it than everybody can do it too @CAPS3 a result i think that technology @CAPS4 a good thing. Therefore I have set my point. And I think that @CAPS4 all so you should have been good technology or technology shall come to you."	1822	
1823	1	"Dear ""The @CAPS1"" I agree with your theory that people spend to much time on the computer, true, you can learn vast knoledge about far away people and places. But if someone were to discover something magnificent, and think ""oh my, I have to create a web page describeing this wonderful place,"" they, at one point in time said ""I should write a book about this"" what I am getting at is that i do not believe that there is anything that is on the internet that we do not have documented in books, the internet can be used for bad purposes, like stalking people, and potential crimes, for example, @CAPS2, people take @CAPS3 quizes and are sometimes giving there password and private information away to strangers. People are also not spending enough time enjoying life if they are cooped up in there house, on the computer. I wanted to hang out with my friend once, he lives in a rural area, and he said it was to cold. It's @NUM1 and I live by the water, you know what he practically said? ""@CAPS4 thanks I wanna sit here and let my life waste away in front of a computer"" People can become so obsesive with electronics these days, the computer is another excuse not to call up your friend, and ask to meet for lunch or a cup of coffee, that is the purpose of computers, but in some cases a computer can be good, and used for good purposes, you can do things that we used to not be able to before computers. I was shown a doctoral website, to show you how to do a knee replacement surgery, and many other kinds of surgerys. They have online @CAPS5 and other animal disections, all these things that could not be accessable without computers, instead of having to drive to work each @CAPS1 and use gasoline, you can work straight from home! So it makes it possible to spend time with your family, set your hours so you can enjoy life, the way life is meant to be spent. But there must be balance, if you want to work at home, you shouldn't spend all your time at home, you need to go out, take a walk, walk your dog(s) or you can hang with a friend! If you live in a city go shopping! Don't spend your life, or most of it locked up in your house, online or not having fan. Those are my thoughts. The internet is used for bad things sometimes, computers can be very addictive, and they can be used for good in some cases, as you can see, or tell, I'm mutual about the internet, those are my opinions, I hope you enjoyed and got a lot out of long paper."	1823	
1824	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 all @CAPS3 have or more computer. They are used for communication, games and to type reports. But computers have more uses. They can be used to medical research, to improve are environment and to create means @ORGANIZATION1 transportation. Computers, I believe, would be hard to live without. They are used in almost everything. Computer are too valuable to our society; we connect rid @ORGANIZATION1 them. Work in the @ORGANIZATION1 has been impacted by computers significantly. When the computer was introduced robots were disigned to deliver redication to different rooms. There as computers advanced, robots could perform precise surgirirs. Computer also helped the medical industry when they started looking at @ORGANIZATION2. With computers, can see happened @CAPS6 a genetic mutation. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 recalls. ""The patient had a small bump on his arm. The computer the tissue taken from the . We had the tissue by hand and found nothing wrong. But the computer found a disease."" @CAPS4, people are saved by computers. COmputers are also useful when studying the weather. They have been key in studying global warming environmental scientist has. Computers can continuously record weather patterns and wind speeds. A human would sit next to an instrument a chart and log the reading. Because @ORGANIZATION1 human ever, the recordings would be off. So, the computer is more accurate. Computers in satelites can take pictures @ORGANIZATION1 ice cops. They automatically how fast the ice is melting, and @CAPS6 the speed @ORGANIZATION1 the melting is constant, it can when all @ORGANIZATION1 the ice will be gas. Without computers, environmental studies would be an science. Transportation is also enriched by computers. I remember when my class learned about. We heard bridge that collapsed due to post designing. When wind the blew, bridge could not support that live lead. With computers, bridge engineers can build bridges electronically. Then, they can use simulaters to put forces on the bridge, like traffic, wind and . Shamal @CAPS5 says, ""@CAPS6 this technology had been used to desing that , the would have saved @MONEY1, and @NUM1 lives."" Technology also made cars safer. Traction control and brakes are all controlled by the car's computer. The car can also sense what temperature the inisde is and adjusts to your . So you can have a comfortable ride. Computers are so useful. They are used @CAPS4 in transpotation, the medical field, and in global studies. Without the computer, our society will take a huge step backwards. "	1824	
1825	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 this as a front page n fad line: ""@CAPS4 suffers from brain damage due to computers!"" computers are a growing phenomenon in the world and each year newer, more advances models are being produced. This, however, doesn't benefit our society like you might think! Due to computers, poeple spend less time excersizing, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends, family, and other citizens. For these reasons, I believe that computers hurt, more than help, our community. To start, people spend far too much time on the computer. Weather it is shopping, playing games, watching movies or even working-it takes up valuable time that could be spent getting exersize! With the growth of computers, obisity issues have grown in the @LOCATION2 as well. Just this year, the @ORGANIZATION1 reported that about three in every five @CAPS5 are overweight. That is a groteque amount of people! on the sublect of @ORGANIZATION1, it has also been discovered that computers can cause eye and brain damage. @PERSON2 helmeg stated, ""@CAPS6, people are spending far too much time on the computers. With not as much exposure to the outdoors and other sources, people are causing long term damage to their eyes and certain regions of their brains."" @CAPS7, as a nation, need to get off the computer and go excersize! In addition to the lack of excersize in our nation due to computers, citizens are not spending as much time enjoying nature. People need fresh air in order to stay healthy! Not only does the outdoors provide fresh air though, but it is a source of beauty and knowledge. Grant @PERSON1, a local senior said. ""I remember my childhood as always being outside. I was never inside longer than absolutely necessary, unlike these days. I learned a lot from the outdoors and it has definatly helped me in life."" @PERSON1 presented a good point too. Having knowledge of the outdoors should be basic common knowledge to everybody in our society. Due to computers thought, the beauty, knowledge and importance of nature is being overlooked and not stressed as much in our country and community. Furthermore, computers create issues with the amount and kind of interaction humans get with one another. On computers, there are many online was to talk weather it is via email, instant message, or video chat, these forms of communication are destroying future generations. This is so because behind a computer, people feel safe. They feel that they can say or act in whatever manner they so choose. This not only leads to bullying, but it can affect the way children and adults interact in person. A recent study conducted by the @CAPS1 youth and family services organization showed that @PERCENT1 of kids are more comfortable communicating with peers on the computer rather than in person. That is a very large amount. If @CAPS7 don't change our use of computers soon, @LOCATION1's future generations could have a huge issue on their hands. All in all, computers have a negative effect on both individuals and our society as a whole. Computers cut into much needed excersize time, limit people's appreciation and exposure to nature, and interfere with social interaction. The next time you support computer use or find yourself logging hours infront of the screen, think of the negative results that occur! Finally, I vehemently improve you to stand up against the over-use of computers in our society and take a stand! Thank you for your consideration to my thoughts."	1825	
1826	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 position on weather or not computers are good or bad for you is that I agree that they are good for you in someways, for example they teach-hand eye coodination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people,and even allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 first explanation is that they teach-hand eye coordination. Computers are good for that because they can be used to teach up or even @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @NUM4 year olds how to count, spell, read, it can also teach you how to type, paint, and design on your computer. Next theres how they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Manily most adults use the computer to search for where they had grown up and what type of life they had, if it was a difficult or easy life. They also search for there private getaway or for a family vacation to @LOCATION1 or to @LOCATION2. However most people dis-agree with me bacause most parents are afraid that there teenagers @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not put innapropriate pictures online or @MONTH1 even go on @CAPS3 for example and your child could be talking to a rapist or a sexual abuser that might be lying just to come to your front door and rape you and then kill you. Well to make sure that that never happens to lock inapporiate websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or any other inappropiate website. Last but not least computers also allow people to talk online with othe people. Most teenagers use there comptuer for this also they basically only use it for chat with their friends and/ or even use it to know whats been goin on lately. Most teenagers use @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 which are basically the samething, most parents dont allow their children to use those websites but there wrong with @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 because know rapist or sexual abuser can add you unless they know your screen which makes it impossible for them to add you. Also when you have @CAPS6 or @ORGANIZATION1 you can give your screen name to your friends which they can then add you. You can also block a person when you dont know them."	1826	
1827	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 up because what I have to say is extremlly important I am a firm believer that computers have negative effects on people. My first reason why I believe computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting the proper amount of exercise. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people are going to perminatly damge their eys. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. In case you @CAPS2't notice, I strongly believe computers have negitive effect on people. My first reason why compuers have a negative effect on people is because people aren't getting enough exercise. People are sitting at home on the computer for the day instead of getting their much needed exercise. Another thing is that the @LOCATION1 has a large amount of obice people living here, so the last thing they need is another exscuse for them not to get their exercise. Stats prove that since computers became increasingly popular, the number of obice people has risen @PERCENT1 from @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT3. As you can see, I believe computers are makeing people spend less time exercising. My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because it is doing perminant damge to their eys. I say this because people sit, on average, @NUM1 feet from their screen. Also, the amount of time spent looking at the screen from so close ranges from @NUM2 hours a day. Dr. @PERSON1, an eye doctor who graduated from @CAPS5, says, "" @CAPS6 this amount of time spent on the computer a day is malntained, then by the year @DATE1 their will be a signifigant increase in the amount of blind people. My @CAPS7 reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because they're not spending enough time with their family and friends. I say this because rather than go spend time with your loved ones, people decide it is more important to constintlly check their facebook. For example, instead of going to a family picnic, you decide you have a fantasy football draft in a little while so you skip the picnic. Another thing is that sitting on the computer all day instead of interatcting with your love ones can cause you to loose contact with them and be left all alone. As you can see I strongly believe computer have a negative rather than a positive effect on people because; they cause you to loose exercise, damage your eyes, and they cause you to loose contact with your loved ones. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter."	1827	
1828	1	"Dear local newspaper, I agree that people do spend more time on computers than actually doing there studies or even excercising. Also people do spend to much time on computers than they normally spend interacting with there own family an friends. I personally think that people should actually spend more time with there own family an friends more than be on the computers on the time also maybe parents should only let students have a certain amount of time because if students get everything they want all they gona do is always be on the computer. Another reason why people should not use computers so much is because the computers could also be so warned out because people be on them to much. Also on a labtop if it get to hot it can catch on fire. Also if you use the computer so much at a time you can get viruses an then your computer will break i think people spend to much time on computer because maybe there family is not the perfect family there maybe be some problems in a family maybe thats all people wanna do is be on a computer. Maybe a computer is a person's best friend. But then again people could get blind from looking at the screens so much."	1828

1830	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly support advances in technology. Not only does a computer help teach hand-eye coordination, but helps others goin knowledge too. It even allows you to interact with others who live far away from you. Most people say sports help people learn hand-eye coordination. Not as many people know that typing does too. Maybe not the @NUM1 - finger crawl, but if people take the time to learn to type correctly, then their aim should improve greatly. This is only one great asset to a computer. If you live here in the @LOCATION2, you probaly don't know much about places like @LOCATION1. To find information on this ice-covered country most people hit the computer. Typing ""@LOCATION1"" on search engines like ""@CAPS1"" is much quicker than paging through dozens of books. You could find the same information with just one click. Sure computers help with hitting the next soft ball, or acing your next history paper. But, what about family or friends who have moved away? Computers can help with that to. Some people fear that kids, and even adults, are spending too much time on the computer. Not enough with family or friend. But, you can connect with them still. Wether it be with someone states away or someone who lives down the street, e-mail and instant messageing servers can help you contact them quickly. I think others should see how important computers can be to daily life. They help teach hand-eye coordination, are quick to find information you need and, help keep close relationship with people who aren't around."	1830	
1831	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 out @NUM2 household in @LOCATION1 own one or more computers. While computers help us look up information more efficiently, they also have negative impacts on ar lives. Computers badly affect humans because they worsen students' academic performance, can be dangerous,a nd make people less healthy. First of all, computers can damage students' education. While computers are helpful to search for information, they can also be abused. Not all websites are appropriate and if a child is supposed to be typing an essay or something, they can easily get distracted on th internet playing games. This can result in a student's grades lowering because they spent more time foolinf arand on the internet than searching for facts relating to a topic in school. Also, students will not learn how to search things the "old-fashioned" way, such as looking for a book in the library using the @ORGANIZATION2. Clearly, computers do more harm than good regarding students' education. Moreover computers can expose people to dangers... With all of the social networking sites nowadays, including @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and instant messaging, it is much easier to contact strangers. My friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4 once went into a chatroom on the computer and began to unknowingly talk to an internet predator. He found out her name and address and came to her house and tried to hurt her. All of this would not have happened if she hadn't entered that chatroom. Even people you know that @MONTH1 not like you can cyber stalk you. As you can see, @CAPS5 information about people is so much easier with computers and some people will abuse that advantage. Additionally, by using computers, people become less healthy. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS6 said that they are less physically active since they bought a computer. This is because with a computer, you do not need to leave your house to find information or be entertained. Instead of walking to the to the library to borrow a book or playing a sport for fun, all you have to do is @ORGANIZATION3 information about a topic or play games online. Furthermore, your eyesight will worsen by by starting at a bright computer screen for hars everyday. By having computers, people's social health also worsen. Instead of having to talk to people face-to-face, you can instant message people. With out a doubt, computers harm yar health physically and socially. In conclusion, computers do not benefit people because students' education is damaged, people can be put in dangerous situations, and yar health can decline. Computers pose as a distraction to students, internet predators can contact you, and you get less physical excersize. I hope you realize that computers do more harm than good."	1831	
1832	1	"Dear Newspaper, ""Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people."" Computers definitely have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, have easy access to information, and at the same time can have fun, and be social. Computer's most definitely should not be a huge concern. Computer's are a big part with helping with hand-eye coordination. If you are playing a game on a i-@CAPS1 and the goal is @NUM1 lap the bubbies that pop up, than the computer will have made it easier is, bubbies quicker. When you are actually on a computer, you can see and tap the keys on the keyboard quicker because of the better hand-eye coordination you have from computers. Another example is if you are in a rush to leave, as soon as you yhour car keys, grab them quicker. This is because of the hand-efe coordination that was improved from computers. This is not the only way computer back effect on people. Computers give easy access to information. For example, if you need to research information on another. Country for homework, than you can your question this a search engine. Also if you are wondering about the lyric can song, you can type in www.lyrics.com into the internet and they will give you the lyrics needed the . If you are in a debate with family about whether or not @CAPS2 is the capital of @LOCATION1, than you can type the question into a search engine. Computers do more than access information easily. With computers, you can also have fun and of social. A way to be social is cheating with an old friend from camp, or from school on www.facebook.com. If you want enteratinment than you can go on www.youtube.com and watch your new and favorite music videos such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 by @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 @CAPS6 @CAPS6 by @NUM2. If the weather is bad outside, you can always go on www.miniclip.com, to play games. Compters are used for many different reasons; more than just fun and being social. Computers do many things such as help with hand-eye coordination easy access to information, and run and social purposes. Computers have a very positive effect. The only issue is overdosing! the time spend on the computer. If you mange your time wisely so than you do other physical activities, than computers are fantastic!"	1832	
1833	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on society. In one little machine there is so much you can do. There are ways to communicate with others and even learn new ideas. The computer really is a benefit. One way the computer is a good invention is that it gives people a chance to do things they wouldn't normally experience. For example if a person wanted to see a picture of @LOCATION1, all they would have to do is type it into a search engine. Also, it makes many tasks simpler for people. Typing on @ORGANIZATION1 is much faster than writing out a letter. Plus, all the information you need is right at your fingertips. Not only is a way to learn. Like I mentioned before, the search engine is a useful computer tool. BY typing a key @ORGANIZATION1 onto the screen, lots of information is accessible. Why would anyone take the time to look through a book when it could take five seconds on the computer? Besides having an infinite amount of information, the computer can give an education. Many people today can't afford to attend a college. The computer makes it easier by giving them online courses so they can work during the day. This helps a hardworking person receive the education they deserve. Another way the computer is beneficial to our society is it makes communication easier. For instance, say a student got a detention and his teacher wanted his parents to know. Instead of mailing a letter which could take days, all the teacher would have to do is send an email. You might say, ""@CAPS2't the teacher call?"" @CAPS3 could but what if the student's parents aren't home? EMail is fast and can arrive at it's destination in under a minute. Another way people communicate on the computer is through sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. Each person is able to set up their own profile and look for people they know. With this ability, one person can find people they had met twenty years ago. It's a great way to reconnect with old friends and talk with current ones. In one little box, people can do so much. Life is made easier through programs like email and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We are able to do things like go to college, from the privacy of our own homes and communicate and share pictures with old and new freinds. The computer is a machine that effects mankind in a good way."	1833	
1834	1	"Computers @MONTH1 be helpful at some times, but they are taking too much valuable time from peoples lives. When people are bored, instead of going outside or doing something productive, they decide to go on the computer. Everything that you do on the computer can be done off of it. Plus, computers @MONTH1 be part of why people are obese. Also, as much as you can talk to friends online it will help you be more social if you didn't talk over the internet. There is more to life that what is on computers. Computers are an easy shortcut to finding the things you desire. Looking for facts for your history project? Go to the library. People in the past didn't have computers, yet they were still smart. You can learn hand-eye cooordination by playing sports, too. Then, you would get your exercise along with it. Although I do agree that is easier to get in touch with people that live far away, you could still do that over the phone. Having trouble with your math homework? Instead of looking up how to do it, like I know I've done many times, go get help from your friend and make a study session. There are plenty of ways to do things that you thought you couldn't do without the computer. How many times have you been on the computer even when it was a beautiful day outside. The computer @MONTH1 be interesting is the world around you. Our obese people percent is becoming larger and larger. I think the computer @MONTH1 be contributing some to this percent. People don't go out for a walk or bike ride as much as they used to. Instead they stay inside and do things like going on the computer. People need exercise to stay healthy. You can't get the exercise you need if you are on the computer. The computer is limiting your social interaction with your peers. Of course on the computer you can talk to them. But, you should be hanging out with them in person. This would boost your social life and let you have fun and enjoy being with friends all at the same time. My friend once told me that sometimes she didn't want to hang out one day even when she had nothing to do. So, she went on the computer. I once read a story in which a girl loved watching tv and because of tv she forgot what she liked and didn't spend as much time doing the things she used to. This is the same as with a computer. People get sucked into them and don't do all the fun things they could be doing like spending time with friends or family. I think that although computers @MONTH1 be helpful sometimes you shouldn't make them a big part of your life. Try to do things without the help of a computer. Go out and get fit and in shape. And, spend less time on the computer and more time outside enjoying your life with friends and family. You can have a life without computers, so go and live it."	1834	
1835	1	"Yes, computers are benefits for society. One they help people such as finding stuff in the enternant. Two computers are etertaining. Last but not least you do whatever you want with it. My first reason was that they help people. I said that because they help people find stuff in the enternant. For example it's good for people to do their homework. Like a project or essay. You could comunicat with family of friends that are away from you like @CAPS1.R. or @LOCATION1. My second reason was that their entertaining. The reason I choose this reason was because computers are good for games and more. For example you sould find games such as racing games or sport games if your into tehm. It has different kinds of games. They also have cool websites. For example @CAPS2.com @CAPS3.com and all sorts of websites. My final is that you could do whatever you want with it. By that I mean that you could got to websites like @CAPS4 thatr you talk to people. Print pictures out for wotk or school work. Anything you want with it, its yours! So their you go you heard all my ideas from finding stuff in the enternet. Two their entetaining. Last but not least you could do whatever you want with it. So their you go, these are my ideas about computers hope you like them!"	1835

Exercise is the way to go you can see all of Nature and you can do many sports to get ative. Technolgy is bad with @CAPS4 you won't get exercise, but without @CAPS4 you can go out and see nature on vaction and hikes. You can go on far away vacations have fun and exersice like going to the beach and swimming or walking. Also if you go on hikes you will see the buety of nature and you get get exercise. A lot of people today don't go out much because of the computers and get fat so a hike will help them a lot. Computers has a down side because people get addicted to them all the time and get lazy and fat. Nature can get you some ware in life like you can love @CAPS4 and try to save @CAPS4 cause you love @CAPS4 so much. Another thing people could instead of playing with the computer is play a sport. There is a sport for everyone out there to do no matter what @CAPS4 is. Also you can be a dare devil and do crazy stunts like jump a canyon or something like that. A lot of people are that use computer and are still in shape so a lot of people that like computers can do that. Another thing is that people love to talk to each other and its not bad to go on a computer once in a while but all the time is very bad for you. Also the people that love there computers don't meet a lot of people at all unless they have friends. In the world today so many people play sports all the time wether its @CAPS5 or football you are still geting active. To sum @CAPS4 all up computers are bad because they don't give you exersice. Also going out to see nature or playing a sport @CAPS4 is exercise and @CAPS4 can help you."	1836

Computars can teach people hand eye coordination learn about far away places, and let people talk with other people around the world. This is why computars are a benifical part of our socitey. Computars can teach people hand eye coordination which is a very useful in the real world because lots of jobs you to use your hands. Most jobs that envole tecnolegy, its good to have hand eye coordination, but to have good hand eye coordination you'll need practice and some people might become obsessed with the computer and never come off while there practicing there coordination which might led them to forget about important things in life like these family but the easy way to fix that is by giving yourself a get time to be on the computer and that shoud never happen. This nis how hand eye coordination is good and how it won't let you lose track of important things in your life. Also computars can be a good learning expercience, they can teach you about far away places like the collisum in @LOCATION4 or the @LOCATION2's of @LOCATION1 and even the @LOCATION3 rain forest and the tribes that live there. Also the computar can help you book flights so you can go to these wonderful places, plus if you go to these places you'll get a serious workout because you'll be out exploring so you don't got fat and unhealthy from sitting at the computar all day lastly I want to say that the computar can teach you about far away and give you a lote of back on them too. this is another reason how the computer can benifit us. Lastly the computar ca allow to have a long distance conversation with people. talking with people, even one's around the world is good because everyone needs to talk to someone now and then, yet sometimes talking can get out hand which what I mean is you'll be on for so long that you'll forget what the outside of your room look's like and what nature is, like I said talking can be good but don't do it every day for the rest of your life because its good to go out for, enjoy nature, even garden this why the computar is good for communication not just because you can talk to you @CAPS1 penpal but so you can learn more about the cultures os the world. That is why the computar is a good and important part of our socity, it can teach us hand eye coordination, teach us about for away places, and even let us talk to people that are on the other part of the globe that why the computars is good even though it can com some our lives but there past that, that is why the computar is important to our society."	1837

On a computer most people will think about going on websites of games. There is more to it than that. Our technology is so advanced that people who use computers can talk via text chat online or a live webcam chat, they make it so we dont always have to drive somewhere and waste gas. The following paragraphs will show why computers are great to use. The way we take care of ourselves. If most people eat and eat constantly what good does that do for them? They need to know @CAPS4 they need to excercise and should do it daily. People do get addicted to computers but that doesnt meen they cant excercise. This @MONTH1 sound weird but @CAPS4 we type a lot of fact we build strength in our hand-eye cordination. The internet also could teach us new ways to exercise not just us running around. Our hands actually get stronger @CAPS4 we type due to the amount of times we use them constantly @CAPS3, @CAPS3 is an excercise. Secondly a computer can prepare kids for future carrers in offices, @CAPS4 we type we memorize where the keys are so soon enough we can not even look at the keyboard @CAPS4 we type. We can also use computer and take college classes and graduate through the internet for people who cant aford to go to a college university. The internet is a great resource for many things, one of the things is to learn another language so you can communicate with other people around the world. We can also learn how to do things due to website youtube. You can upload anything on the website and become viral over the internet and show off you own content. The internet has websites that can help you select future jobs, display you own stuff, or just view many things. Last but not least the internet has websites like facebook that will let you interact with your friends or family members who accept a request from so you never meet any strangers or can get harmed either way. Its a easier way to communicate father than driving to meet someone or hogging the house phone. The computers come with so many features that make everyone who uses a computer a lot easier to use. They now make touchsmart computers and wireless mouses. A computer is not just for us to have fun on. It teaches us subjects in depth. Its great to have a computer because you can learn about different subjects, you can interact with other people around the world, or you can prepare youreself. for a future job. Computers are not bad at all they do things for us that we could never think of computer are great to own."	1838
