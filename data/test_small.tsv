2383	1	"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They help you stay in touch with family in a couple different ways they excercise your mind and hands and help you learn and make things easier. Computer's help you keep in touch with people. Say you live in @LOCATION1 and you miss your @CAPS1. You can just send an e-mail and talk all you want. If you don't just want to limit it to words you can add pictures so they can see how much you've grown or if you are well. Even if you're just e-mailing someone down the block it is just as effective as getting up and walking over there. You can also use a computer to make a scrap book card or slide show to show how much you love the person you give them to. Computers @MONTH1 not excercise you whole body but it excersises you mind and hands. You could play solitaire on the computer and come away @PERCENT1 smarter than before. You can play other games of strategy like checkers and chess while still sitting at home being comfortable. Your hands always play a big role while you're on the computer. They need to move the mouse and press the keys on a keyboard. Your hands learn all the keys from memorization. It's like the computer's teaching handi-coordination and studying habit for the future. Computers make human lives easier. Not only do they help kids turn in a nice neatly printed piece or paper for home work but they also help the average person. Teachers use it to keep peoples grades in order and others use it to write reports for various jobs. The @CAPS2 probably uses one to write a speech or to just keep his day in order. Computers make it easier to learn certain topics like the @LOCATION2 history. You can type something into a searcher site and have ton's of websites for one person with, who knows how much imformation. Instead of flipping through all the pages in a dictionary you can look for an online dictionary, type in the word and you have the definition. Computers have positive effects on people because they help you keep close to your family, they challenge your mind to be greater and excercise your hands and they make life easier for kids and the average person. This is why, I think computers have good effects on society."	2383	
2384	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I know some problems have came up where some individuals do not agree with the benefits that computers provide us with. I am writing this to get my voice out, or how computers can only help us. Computers teach us hand eye coordination which is an essential skill for many new jobs is this day and age. Not only do computers teach this hands skill but they allow for us to learn of faraway places without actually going to that place and they allow is to talk and intersit with our friends, family and even! Computers are incredible in that they give us the chance to learn of a place where we can not go. Since the creation at the internet, studies have proven that our country's overall average intelect has increased by over @PERCENT1! @PERSON2 has a remark a this subject."" I am astranded that such a simple idea has turned out to be the largest virtual library has ever known!"" I could not help but to agree with him. Many people have learned of faraway places, reachable and unnexchable, in amazing detail just by viewing articals that the internet and computers offer. I have to admit that you have to sit down and read @CAPS2 which doesn't benefit you physically but it majorly benefits you mentally in a very minimum amount at time. Hand eye coordination is one of the most underectinated skills that computers provide. Technology is only going to advance, so why not get i over with and adapt to the new ways that things are being done by? Hand eye coordination is an essential skill in the jobs we have @DATE1. Someone who has expirienced hand eye coordination would tell you that the practice and the was with it because they can get papers and projects done faster, and more efficiently. A fast typer can make as much as @MONEY1 an hour when they first set hired! Only computers teach this skill and it is almost imposible to learn this skill from something else. A new advancement in technology allows as to interact with one friends, family, and over forieners! Besides the cheap monthly cost of the internet, most of @CAPS2 services are completely free! Instead of wasting minutes on your exposive cellular phone, you can just chat with your friends and family online for free. @CAPS2 free social services can even connect you with people in different countries, so you can learn about their lifestyle and culture as I did! @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS2 advancements are remarkable and everybody should take advantage of @CAPS2 services."" I hope what I've said has an impact on you. Like I said before technology is only going to advance, so be love to adopt to it. Please take into consideration that computers train essential hand eye coordination, they allow us to pull articals of faraway places from a massive virtual library and they allow us to interact with our friends family, and people from all of life."	2384	
2385	1	"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers aren't the reason why people don't want to excersise or veiw the nature. Its the people computers are their their to help peopl can knoledge but people take advantage of that. People make their own in life and they can control eather they want to do excersise or not. They, always have the on other objects for what they suposably didn't do. In a couple people can go anywhere and reaseach everything. Poeple who stay at a computer @NUM1 hours a day are making discison. Its not like a computer tell you not to do something people beleive that technology as a person into doing things. Well their wrong. Its the person who is letting technology take control. Because if they wanted to they could possibly stop and go out side for a walk or run. What they don't know is they are the one. So now you understand what im trying to say. People other things over ther own actions."	2385	
2386	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 has come to my attention that some people do not believe in our in technology and their computers. I however believe that computers are amazing things that make life not only easier, but more enjoyable as well. Computers teach hand-eye coordination which is available through sports as well, but much easier for the unathletic through computers. Not only do computer give us skills but they allow us to learn of the people nd places to us. Yet computers are not so along with getting information on far away people and places you can actualy talk to a person from anywhere around the world! In our local comunity only about @NUM1 of the population are at and capable of truly hand -eye coordination through sports. This is where computers are useful. They can teach hand-eye coordination to anyone. This skill is taough by a hand- held controler called a mouse that once moved will also move a person or the computer screen. This is a vere effective techmique that is even useful with special people. Computers give us access to pictures and information on far away people or places. This is a very useful thing, since @CAPS3 allows you, our local paper, accurete news ion both distant and local events. @CAPS3 is also proven that students have a better on of a place if they can see @CAPS3. If by a terrible chance computers were removed from our society, our students would reserve lower scores on world geography quizzes or even tests. By such a reasoning taking away computers taking our knowledge on places. Computers not only help to give us a better understandings on foreighn places, but they also allow us a one on one @CAPS5 with people of such places. Such a things our knowledge. @CAPS3 also allows people contact with family or friends @CAPS3 is very painful to know you will never see somore you care for again but computers lead that pain. Computers also to news, for example if a family member was about to one could just get on the computer and a culture. If one were to a letter saying by the they got there @CAPS3 could be too late. And thus I implore you, our local paper, to support our fight to keep computers. Some people @MONTH1 say that computers internet as with people but @CAPS3 actualy encourage out.People my online through websites suhc as facebook and myspace. These amazing machines give us skills, information, and easy @CAPS5 like nothing else."	2386	
2387	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I think that people have lately spent too much time on their computers. People who have been doing so are increasing the percentage of obecity. The reason I am writing this to you is because the percentage of obecity is currently increasing, people are spending less time exercising and spending less time interacting with others. First, the percentage of obecity is increasing. The reason is that people just stay indoors, they never feel the need to be fit. This is also risking their lives, all they do is just sit and eat. This could risk the chances of getting deceases. For example, lets say a person spends nearly @NUM1 hrs a day on the computer. This person ate salty foods which risked high cholesterol. While this person was using the computer this person had a heart attack. Second, the people who use the computer are not exercising. These people need to exercise, its good for them, it helps them avoid having to take trips to the hospital, by that I mean not getting heart attacks. It is important to at least exercise for @NUM2 hrs. a day. Do something like take a walk in the park, go hiking, ride a bike, do push ups. There's all kinds of things you could do. For example, there was once a man that all he did was use the computer, he once used to be athletic until his mother gave him a computer. After that he only used the computer, he never exercised nor comunicated with his friends. That was until his friends told him that he was too addicted to that machine. So his friends helped him get back on his feet. Finally, people don't interact with their own friends and family. This is the biggest thing that you should be concerned because with computers people don't interact with themselves and @MONTH1 cause relationships to get ruined. The difference between the average man and the man that uses computers is that the average man actually has a job and has to support his family, while the man that uses computers all he actually does is play games or use the social networks to communicate with strangers. In conclusion, you should be concerned about people's use of computers. It increases obecity. It decreases the interaction with others and you'll spend less time exercising and more time on the computer. Please do the whole world a favor and just go out to play or exercise."	2387	
2388	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is in my firm belief that to many people spend far too much time on their computers these days. Computers can be a very useful tool, but they can also be very harmful. I think that being on a computer consistently (day after day), degrades a person's communication skills, @CAPS2 lowers the exercise they get which hurts their healthy, but if a person manages to balance this time equally betwenn being on a computer and everything else in life then you will succed. Although computers are very valuable resources, spending too much time on them could hurt a person's communication skills. For example, if you sit on your butt all day in front of a computer you won't have any interaction with the outside world. So the next time you actually talk (and not just e-mail or text) someone, you will flounds. You won't know what to say or how to act because you haven't done @CAPS2 for so long. Now I understand that in some jobs you have to work on a computer all day. That's fine @CAPS2's just when you do @CAPS2 nepeditivley that @CAPS2 starts to harm you. You won't be able to laugh and joke around with your friends the way you used to because you'll be spending the whole time thinking about what to say next. Typing to your friends on your computer is much different than actually greating to them in person. These reasons are why I seriously believe that spending time on a computer will will your communication skills. No matter the you are on the computer. Besides hurting your communication skills. Spending too much time on the computer gives you no. Having no exercise is very unhealthy and can lead people to becoming obese. Another harmfull is sitting around all day, only exercising your fingers can lead to arthritis which is becoming a bigger problems in young people not only can you get arthritis, but there are many more dangerous symtoms of having on your computer for too long. The main problem is in the lack of of health that you develop and we all know how important our health is. @CAPS2 can affect our progress how we and just lives in general. So spending to much time on a computer is a serious health issue because of the lack of exercise that you receive. Though not all is bad with the computer. @CAPS2 seem very valuable tool and is a great source of knowledge. Only be our time equally between the time we spend on the computer and the time we give to everything else in the world. Do we achieve. For instance maybe you want to look up the symtons of mans. Okay spend about an hour on the computer in searching and then go out side and play with your dog in the bright @DATE1 day. You could even combine your time on the computer with a friend. Play a video game together joke and laugh. So computers are in great thing, but we must be able to balance our time on them and on everything around us. In conclusion I say again that a computer is a great tool, only when @CAPS2 is not abused. People cannot spend too much time on the computer because @CAPS2 degrades their communication skills and ruins their health because @CAPS2 allows no exercise, however when we balance our time between the computer and everything else we got the best of both world message."	2388	
2389	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 your computer have you so addicted? Computer's have an effect on people because people line to go on myspace, look for job's, watch videos. If you think about it about half the state goes on myspace and talk to friends and meet new people but is it a good idea to meet people you dont know? no. Well this girl named @PERSON2 was talking to this boy josh one day, and he supposelly was @NUM1 she was, but then they met at a store and he took her and probally killed her because she came on the news missing, he was really @NUM2. Many people look for job's on the computer because their to lazy to get up get ready and go out looking. Also, this girl @PERSON1 did an application for @CAPS2's and she didn't hear back from them she was curious. So she went down there and they told her she should of came in because the didn't get the application from the computer. She was mad she stayed there and argued for a whole @NUM3 minutes. Do you love to watch music videos almost everyday? Almost everychild that has a computer in there house watches music videos because they have nothing else better to do. Also, if you've noticed on the videos there. Dances people want to learn how to do. For example, there's these jerk group called the @ORGANIZATION1's and they jerk it's a dance. Everyone that watches the video jerks in school, the mall, a battle for anywhere. They know how to do this because they writen music videos all day. @CAPS1 your computer have you so addicted? computers have an effect on people because people like to go on myspace, look for job's, watch music video's. Just remember don't let your computer have an effect on your life or what you wan't will not turn out right."	2389	
2390	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I agreed with the people that feel that people should spend more time with the family instead of being stuck on the computer or laptop. I know that computer could be fun to chat or play game but also need to spend more time with your family for example go camping and parks, swim, fish, and go on vacation. Also want to spen as much time as posible just in case something gose wrong you will always remember the good times you had together. You also could help your grandparint build a gardin or play games. Instead of being a computer or a laptop you could big food chlose for you or your children you can even go to a restaurant. You can do al sorse of thing instead of beang on the computer. You can even go to a zoo to learn about all of animal. Like I sed I dont wayst your time on a computer on somewere and enjoy your life."	2390	
2391	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I do not believe that computers are helping today's society. I feel computers are making our situation here in @LOCATION1 worse. Now a day's you see less people in parks playing catch or teenagers signing up for there local sports team, because they're too busy signing up for a ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" acount. People are for example when I went to work with my aunt I saw so many adults on their laptos during there lunch brake, instead of enjoying their limited time off to relaxe and get out of the office. Me a s a teenage girl hear my friends always talk about how they meet this cute boy on ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" or ""@CAPS7"". when they don't even know if the boy is a boy at all. So so I don't think that's safe for teenagers or adults. Another example is when I was watching the news yesterday a man was selling his truck on ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". One person took the pffer but they kept on changing the location of were they were going to meet to pick up the car. When tehy finaly picked a location they met. (@CAPS10 was a secluded area). They buyer wasn't planning on buying the car he was going to rob the man and kill him. This proves that the internet isn't safe. My final plea is ther isn't alot of people visiting their families and friends instaed they email them. my opinion is @CAPS10's not the same, you can't spend quality time with a email. You can't send love by instant messaging. I know this because my brother is a @LOCATION2 @CAPS11 and he sends me and my brothe picture mail of him in @LOCATION3. @CAPS10's not the same I will still miss how he would tease me or embarass me infront of my friends and computers and emails will never replace that."	2391	
2392	1	"Imagine that you walk into a friends home and their home is just actually dirty. That the reason they don't got time to clean is because their just always playing on the @CAPS3 technology. The issue is, people are getting lazy, and most of them won't want to spend time with their loved ones, also they'll start to get addicted to it. It is now or never to help these young people with their weakness as being on the internet. What would you do if you were to be with someone who was always on the internet doing nothing? Your trying to help them and they won't do it because they're just too used of doing nothing. Your house is a mess just because of the fact that they're too lazy. Well this is whats causing all this trouble. People attend to get used of being on the @CAPS3 doing nothing. That is just unacceptable, @CAPS1 have to do something bout this. Also computers are making most families, and couples break up. Do you really know what's causing this, is all of the @CAPS3 technology. It's hard for families to stick together and connect if their children are always playing games on the @CAPS3 and the father/mother is on the internet. This can also bring conflict to the family well only because if the kids are on the @CAPS3 while one of the parent is trying to get on that could bring conflict. And conflicts always mislead to something worst. @CAPS2 lets just try to stop using the @CAPS3 to prevent this from happening. @CAPS2 your trying to go to your friends house but he wen't up the @CAPS2 you think something going on with him. @CAPS2 you to his house to see whats going on and you come to find out is their just paying too much to the @CAPS3 because of this game. But just everytime you'll try to hang out with him he's hooked on to that same game. @CAPS2 you try to help him out by going on the date. While your on the date he's all sweaty @CAPS2 your asking him why and he says the reason why is because he is not playing the game @CAPS2 this is just leading to a conclusion which is that he's addicted to the game. This is one of the most dangerous things to happen. The time is now to help people to get up and out of all these crazy stuff. Would you want to have a lazy friend living with you? Would you want your family to break up because of a technology system? Or do you want to be with a boyfriend who's addicted to the technology called ""@CAPS3""? @CAPS2 let's help and prevent all of these things to happen to anyone."	2392	
2393	1	"Dear people of the @LOCATION1, I would like to inform you on the dangers of computes. Picture, if you will, an empty world. @CAPS8, there are people all right but they are all at home. On their computers, wasting away and being slowly blinded in front of the screen. Imagine empty streets and parks. Children streaming out of the school doors and into the sweet smell of freedom that lies, ready in the air of @DATE1 vacation. They are excited But only so they can spend their @DATE1 on the @CAPS1, @CAPS2'ing, chatting, on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, bliss, or whatever it is they do. The point is that @DATE1 is the time of outdoors sun, heat, sand, beaches, pool, comp, friends. Not solely to electric devices. Because if anyone was on the computer all the time (adults included) nothing would get done. Babies would cry, would grow wild, houses unpainted, taxes un-accounted, criminals let loose and the innocent victim would remain in terror, waiting for the day @CAPS7 comes back for her. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS8, that's hardly probable, of course we'd all got to work."" but I wouldn't be so sure. What would you do if you were ""this close"" to winning your favorite game, in the middle of an ""important"" conversation, reading up on @CAPS14 to be economically smart. Exactly you keep your caboose right in that slightly uncomfortable computer chair. But I @CAPS9 the point is nothing that needs doing would get done. The world would fall into chaos. Everyone would need something and no one would be able to tear themselves away from the screen to give it to them. Too much computer exposure could also lead to a rise on what is already a increasing problem obesity. People would gradually gain weight and have no way to release the unneeded calories. Think about it; all of humanity would basically only be doing @NUM1 - @NUM2 things, eating, drinking, using the bathroom, sleeping, and maybe smoking. It's not like the @CAPS1 is @CAPS11 fitness or something all you do is sit, type, store, and click. And as the obesity statistics go up the life expecting will go down. We will die sooner. Is that the kind of them we want over our beads raising our children? ""This is a computer @CAPS12 @CAPS13 let me show you @CAPS14 to use it. ""@CAPS14 about when @CAPS12 is a obese @NUM3-year-old chain smoking living alone and dying of lung cancer. She wouldn't even be able to get treatment what then huh? What happens to @CAPS12? Do you know what happens when humans don't interact with each other? They became anti-social, hostile and frankly crazy. No one would know @CAPS14 to deal with other people since they stay at home in their own little world. Simple, harmless gestures would scare them and trigger an attacks. We'd be take feral, independent animals we so much as approach another person and all hell breaks lose. We'd be de-evolutionized into a near state of nature. Everyone for himself. In conclusion computers are dangerous and bad for you. However computers in moderation is good. The @CAPS1 can be a bad place when it comes to children or adults. @LOCATION2, teens such as myself. I should know. So please write an article on it, warn the people about the danger they are unknowing subjected to. I'll even give you the headline ""The @CAPS18 of the @CAPS1 @CAPS20"" @CAPS21 it'd be nothing but benificial to the world."	2393	
2394	1	"We all have computer at home and I think that computer benefit society. Oneway is that compoter's can help people read in some caseis. My next resone is that it can let people lerne about other plase around the would and mat new people, @CAPS1 reson is that in som casees if a person gose messing or if it is a long lost reality you can find them on a computer. I will just put it this way say that you want to go on a vacasm and you are no wer near a @CAPS2 and you have a you can buy plan tickes online and then go to the @CAPS2 and just get on the plan and go to waraver you wand to go that is fast. If you are tring to find a job in the newspaper stop and thein go to a computer and find it online that is the way."	2394	
2395	1	"Imagine a life without computers. Can you really think of what it would be like not to have them? I know it is imposible for me to see us living without them. Computers have affected our lives so much since there creation. Some @MONTH1 think that people are becoming to attached to them, but I think differently. Computers are the source of our knowledge. Lots of what we learn how is from the computer. Computers help to stay in contact with others. They help to communicate back in forth with others on the other side of the world. Computers have also become a great part of school. So keep reading and follow along as you trulu relice how much you are effected by a computer. Where do you get all your information today? How do you find what you looking for? The first thing most of us do is turn to the computer. It's full of information on everything. From how to make potroast to some bizare frog that lives at the tip of @LOCATION1. You can find whatever your looking for on the computer. The only reason we know so much is because of the search engines like @ORGANIZATION3. Using a computer makes it easier to find what ever your looking for or researching. Instead of waiting @NUM1 min. of your pressus time looking up the capital of @LOCATION4 in can encyclopedia you could spend a minute or two searching for it on the computer an discover it's @LOCATION2. The computer just keeps adding more and more information and you can learn more from it then from a book. Lots of people today have facebook, twitter, aim, or at least an e-mail. What do each of these have in common? They are use every day to communicate with others. Our computers help to keep in touch with people we don't see every day or @MONTH1 live on the other side of the world. Best friends can talk about what they did today or a bussness man in @LOCATION3 can talk face to face with this partner in @LOCATION5. About @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have a family memeber that lives out of there home country, but with out the use of computers how would they keep in touch. They could send letters, but that takes a while to reach the other person and can cost money yoiu can't afford to spend. The computer can let you talk to that person by e-mail, instant messaging, or even face-to-face webcam. Now in school computers are being used more than ever. They contain our books for school, help us write papers, and supply us with the information to do report. For me and other students from our school our school books are located on the computer incase we @MONTH1 forget in bring it home. Most of the esiments I get for @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 have to be typed written. Alot of our projects require information suplied by the computer and then the information goes into a powerpoint or word. Languages like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @CAPS6 are being taught on @ORGANIZATION2 connected to the computer. As you @MONTH1 have relized computers are a big part of the things we each day. They help us to learn more, keep in touch, and are a part of school. With out computars life would be alot harder. Computers help to benifit out society"	2395	
2396	1	"Imagine life without computers, this would break down society all the way back to the stone age. It's been put into question if computers really are beneficial to society. I believe that computers are infact a big part @MONEY1 the daily persons lifestyle. For these reasons. They aid buisinesses, help people keep in touch or ""communicate,"" and help our education. As previously stated, computers and buisnesses with many tasks. Such as school, very often students come across vicious reports that require internet, imagine instead @MONEY1 @NUM1 mins trying together hour at the library gathering insufficient amounts @MONEY1 information. One week reports become reports that can take up to a month! Also computers help school with attendance which the almighty infinite campus which makes by clicks and. But without computers which could be easily done computer @NUM2 seconds. In addition, it helps buisnesses with designing. Now, there are programs that help people such as buildings and diagrams to show stock market. You could luxurious building on a lap top then virtually test the building against the elements, if it breaks you can easily design a new one. On the other hand you go and create a building and estimate together survive mother nature's element and waste @MONEY1 just to find out it broke down @NUM3 days later. Moreover, the computers interest. it helps us with taxes as well without computers no internet and that means we're book to balancing our check books and driving miles just far a item that isn't being sold in local shops to summarize computers play a great part in our businessess today. As i mentioned, computers help us with day-to-day communication. One way our friend the computer helps us with communication is it allows us to instant message each other through the internet free @MONEY1 charge. It helps relations with friends that are overseas stronger, not make a wider gap between us. Without our ""handy dandy computers"" to revise ""blue clues"" we would be limited to the slow boring letters and with a for just to one letter. The computer also good quality communication with friend's nosy people. I remember back in @DATE1 my brother would always read my to my and laugh."	2396	
2397	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you own your own computer? Whether @CAPS2 be a special school computer, laptop or your everyday desktop computer, Technology has a big impact in our lives and in my oppinion @CAPS2’s a good thing! Computers improves our lives while helping develop our education. Along with keeping us connected around the world and giving the human species a way of @CAPS10 and change of lifestyle. Now think about this; @CAPS2's your freshman year in college and everything is going swell until you hear your profesor assign the class a @NUM1 page essey on study of animal hybernation. Sound difficult? This is where computers come to the rescue! Computer can help you with a lot of school assignments and just everyday research. @PERCENT1 of ordinary teenagers and adults took a poll on googleme.net agreeing that computers have helped them in the most tremendous ways. ""@CAPS3 one point @CAPS4' have used them to find vaccines and special diseases not yet discovered in my area"" says @PERSON1. A trained nurse @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. Speaking of @LOCATION1, how @CAPS1 you keep in contact with people who dont have a phone? Well try the computer! Many websites like @CAPS5™ or @CAPS6™ are ways to get in touch with the people you haven't seen in a while! Check up on your @CAPS7 sweetheart or take a look @CAPS3 that crush you've had for awhile! Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS8 alone have computers just to keep contact with others. Its a way to discover different people in different places! Music, @CAPS9, @CAPS10 in general! Without @CAPS2, the world would be a drag! Did you know that most actors and famous people today were discovered by posting a video of themself on website called @CAPS11? Yes @CAPS2's true! About @PERCENT3 of celebrities are known for their talent on @CAPS11. @CAPS2's a change in lifestyle. Speaking of lifestyle, the computer can also help you in your search to change. Finding a home or just shopping online! Anything is possible. Now I know your probably thinking too much time on the computer isn't good for your health! Or what good is a computer if you have to pay for internet? Well remember that site @CAPS11? Go there and type in anything that interests you. Whether @CAPS2 be dance, piano or volleyball. @CAPS11 fans will teach you right @CAPS3 home, where you could get your excercise and enjoy doing @CAPS2! Now, internet is a simple thing to resolve. Companies like comrast™ or @CAPS12 play™ have great deals for a low monthly price! Things are different today.

2398	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on the effect of computers is that they dominate us, and we end up spending far too much time in their grasp. Rather than checking the lates + fashions, or learning that your friend is going to sleep, we should be being productive. We should be doing more useful things with our time, like exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with our family and friends. Rather than spending all of our time frivolously fooling around on a computer, we should and ought to be exercising. @PERCENT1 of our population is overweight, so we really need to get out and exercise. America @MONTH1 be one of the larger powers in the world, but we have far too many pudgy people. And people who get that way normally do not stop. This leads to overall sloth fullness. The computers is the source of this problem. All of the nature in our world is going fast. The trees are getting hacked down and not replaced. Acid rain from pollution is tearing down acres and acres of dells and hollows full of trees. The habitats being destroyed also lead to the threatening and eventual extinction of many species of animals. So we must go out and see the world, enjoy it, before it is torn to pieces. But we can't because we are far too busy checking the lates @CAPS3 updates. I remember many times asking friends to hang out, but they couldn't because they were too busy on the computer. We must spend time with our family and friends! If we don't people, being people, will have all their feelings bottled up, and than explode on someone because of their choice to be a hermit up, locked in their room on the computer. Though people @MONTH1 argue against its talking on facebook, or emailiing is not communicating. It is just being too lazy to actually be with friends and family. We need to see each other, hold friendships. It is very important for our sanity and well-being. Computers are the source of laziness, and just a temporary way to forget the world. We should be exercising, which would do us a lot of good in an overweight country, enjoying nature before it disappears on as completely, and spending time with the people we love and care about. We are lazy, and computers are the source of the problem. So it's time to uproot it."	2398	
2399	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, More than @PERCENT1 of computers are sold more and more every year. Almost @PERCENT2 of those buyers say that this peice of technology is our future. Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I'm here to bring up a situation. Most people own computers/laptops now a days, and the question is.. Do computers/laptops have a good effect from them? Well, the answer to that questions is @CAPS9 because they teach hand eye coordination, has the ability to learn about all the other things you cant learn about in your area, and it has the ability to talk to others from there computers/laptops.

He also says that his computer can video chat with his friends so he can see and hear them too. Some people might say, ""People sent too much time on there computers or laptops not getting enough exercise."" @CAPS9 but, people all the time will go mobile and be able top joy, walk, run, or any other types of exersizing while browsing than on a mobil device internet. So as you can see, computers/laptops can give off a good effor for daily lifes of people. They teach hand-eye coordination, be able to learn about other areas, and chat with friends online. The time is now! I strongly suggest going over what I have said. So.. Are you with me? Call or text me at (@NUM1) @NUM2 and tell me what you think."	2399	
2400	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are very advanced in technology and they give off both positive and negative effects on people. As a person I believe they give more positive effects than negative because the @CAPS3 helps you with research, convesating online, and its fun! Have you ever sat in the house on a rainy day bored to death? Then hop on the @CAPS3. It has many interesting sites that would ease your boredom. The @CAPS3 is a very fun technical device. There are millions of different sites with games to entertain you, and not only for children adults too! One site such as www.addictinggames.com, it has all types of games for you to. Say if you don't have internet and you want to play a game well you text not readable until end of page @NUM1 information you @MONTH1 need but thats way more work then needed, so use a @CAPS3.

2401	1	"Computers are ruining people. I think computers are a big distraction of todays youth, most of all. They want to play games on the computer instead of play games outside. People are using computers for more time than they exercise or even just going outside. People need to log off their computers. One way computers are distracting are people talking in their friends on the computer. It's good to keep in touch and all but, maybe people should see those people and talk to them in person. @PERCENT1 of people would rather talk to friends in person than though video chat on a computer. I know I would want to really speak to someone in person. Computers also distract young kids. Children want to play games on the computer and not outside. @LOCATION1 is an obese country. The youth of @LOCATION1 is struggling with obesity. Children should love running around and playing sports after school. Instead only @PERCENT2 of kids between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 go outside and play after school. COmputers prevent people from doing things. If people want to figure out something they ""google"" it. instead of using the internet find out for yourself. If you cant to know what the main dish is @LOCATION2 is, go to @LOCATION2 and find all. Computers keep people inside and away from the world. Log off the internet and explore the world on your own! Computers might have pictures of the great wall of @LOCATION3 but I went to see it for myself. I want to ride a dirt bike outside, not on a computer. Do you not want to see the world through your eyes and not a computer? "	2401	
2402	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 is obvious or should be obvious to everyone that computers have mainly had a positive effect on everyone. There are some that argue about how computers have made things worse but in reality our world has just improved with this highly sophisticated manor. If  our people of @LOCATION1 didn't have our computers we would all be lost. Computers are spontaneously fascinating because they keep people learning about what's going on in the rest of the world, they let people communicate in a matter of seconds, and they help people learn about anything they want. The first detail of why computers have benefited us so well is how @CAPS1 helps us learning about the world. Whenever you go on website there is probably and telling you something that's happening in another country. Without computers people would never know of the starvation of the people of @LOCATION2. If you go to any news website the homepage usually tells you a lot about something important happening in the world right now. Even after these facts people still say you can just read a newspaper. This is very false however. If you are reading the news and something big happens the news can't change. If you read newspaper online however, the sites are constantly edited keeping you exactly up to time on what's going on, without computers our country would sound ignorant and foolish for we woudn't have an idea of what's going on in the world. The continuing detail on why computers are intriguingly important is because people can communicate with a chatter in a matter of seconds. If you need to ask something to someone you can just send them message and they get back to you very quickly. People will say @CAPS2 can do these things but they can't do one thing a computer can do and that's webcam. With a webcam you can contact a person and talk them like you're with them. You can even see them on your computer screen. This is great for friends that move away or parents that are on work trips. You just click on the webcam button and the person you want to webcam with and you can see them without even being near them. Computers bring communication to a whole new level and without @CAPS1 we'd be out of date and lost. The last reason computers have done only goods is that @CAPS1 helps people learn of whatever they'd like. If you need to learn about something for a project instead of searching through a book store or library or a book store you just search up wahat you need and find @CAPS1 out. You can type whatever you want to learn about into a computer and learn all about the subject in an hour. Computers have made our society more intelligent and that will help us in the long run to keep our human race alive. We maybe people who rely on technology but in our generation @CAPS1 is only making us smarter with all of its computer search engines. After the facts that have been presented here @CAPS1's plain to see that computer have done so much good for custle bad just fades a way. These ingenius devices keeps us informed of the worlds problems, let people communicate in a matter of seconds, and they let people learn of whatever they want very quickly. There are so many positives affects computers have had on us that @CAPS1 is almost impossible to beleive they are a problem like a egative affect on us."	2402	
2403	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2! My name is @PERSON1, and I've been noticing how computers are becoming more of a popular topic. Some people say they think computers are unecessary, while others dissagree. My standpoint on this subject is more of a supporting than dissagreeing, mainly because it allows you to obtain info in a snap, it allows you to talk to people easily, and it can advance our technology further. First of all, computers are like a huge filling cabinet filled with information, weather it be on the first @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or a basket ball game that was on @TIME1. With the click of a mouse, you can find almost anything in the world, even as its happening! Computers are such a good resource, that if you are wondering something and you just can't figure out the answer, just hop on the computer and poof! You have what you're looking for in two-tenths of a second! I truly believe computers are awesome information finders. To continue, computers also have the ability to allow you and a friend to talk to each other. Weather you prefer @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on, there are always many options to chatting it up with a friend, far-away family member, or, anyone, really! Communication is key. You can have a conversation with someone without having to say a word! If someone is near a computer, like, they have a laptop, but their cellphone died and there arent any phones around, they could send an @CAPS10 or @CAPS11-mail and ask for help from a friend or family member. Overall, computers are a great alternative for communication. Lastly, computers have a very important and useful ability, they can advance us further into technologie's future. just imagine a world where computers are ten times faster than they are now, and everyone has video chat. They would all receive updates from around the world, and know almost everything thats going on! Our society would benefit from these improvements by so much. This is why I believe computers can easily advance us greatly in technology. To wrap up, I believe computers are necessary in daily life. They allow us to obtain information, talk to people, and advance ourselves further. I hope you agree with me and spread the word about computers. Thank you for your time."	2403	
2404	1	"Dear Newspaper, I do believe computers are better for society for various reasons; going green. Contacting friends/family and also, @CAPS1 around the world. There are pros & cons about computers but, they mainly are for the best. First going green is a big problem in our society because many people don't recycle. If we all use computers there wont be a reason for us to use paper and need to recycle. Everything we will need we can get of the computer. For example teachers print there work off a computer so why print it if we can all use computers. Yes, many people don't get alot of excerise but, we can fix that & have a solution. Going green & doing everything on computers would & will help the world/earth a lot. Another reason for using computers is because many of us have family out of country or state & not always can we get to a phone. Using a computer will make everything quicker. For example, you pay internet once a month & you can do whatever you want on it & stay however long on it. But if you call you need to buy a calling card &/or you have limited time it will cost more. Mailing letters take too long & won't get there for a while. Computers is a right there, fast & quick. Finally my third & final reason is @CAPS1, yes there are predators on computers but they're going to be everywhere, so you can't let them stop you from doing what you have to do. Sometimes, television & Newspaper dont cost or print out information quick enough or correctly. Or just print & cast whats around them. Maybe your not from here & something happens to your country & you want to cnow what happens you can go online & figure it out quickly. Even though the internet/computers has it bads, it also has its positives so, yes get out & play, enjoy nature. But at the same time take advantage of what you got. There are just some reasons why i believe computers are good for society."	2404	
2405	1	"The effects that computers have an people are good. They allow us to learn about faraway places, allow us to talk with other people and they teach people how to do thins. The computer allows us to talk with others. Some families have relatives in far away places. This makes it hard fo then to keep in touch with each other. Thanks to the computer they can easily e-mail or video chat to get the latest on what is happening or just even to say, ""@CAPS1"". The computer also allow for buisness meetings. If a mom or dad has a child at home, they can't go into work. They can still attend meetings by going on the computes though. All they have to do is get a web can and they can be as active participator at the office from home. Another task that one could complete on the computer is the organize events. One year I had a birthday party and didn't feel like writing invatations. I sent a e-mail to my friends and all of the @CAPS2.S.V.P'd from the computer. Without the computer, many people couldn't communicate with others. The ocmputers allow us to learn about faraway places. Many people chose vacations on the internet. People are able to access the internet and search fun locations in, say, @LOCATION1. They would find that these are many amusement parks and restaurants in @LOCATION1. If that's what they are looking for, then the family would go to . The computer also allows us to see foutage of places we haven't seen. Say your from @LOCATION3 and you really want to se the inaguration of @LOCATION4 in @LOCATION2. That isn't a problem. Sites like @ORGANIZATION1 would bring you live coverage from your computer. Computer also allow people to fly to far away places. The navigation system and many electornics on the plane are made with computers. Without a navigation system, planes wouldn't be able to fly far distances. Computers do a lot to help people learn of far away places. Computers help us learn things. Some colleges have online courses to teach students. A new survey shows that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 college degrees come from online schools. Computers help us build things. This year in @CAPS3. class we built a bird house. I got my design off on internet site which largly helped me build the bird house. Computers also help us coule. These are many sites which have great recipes for cookies, pasta or any kind of food you can think of. Computers are benifiting to society. The internet is useful for teaching us and for researching far away places. Computers also let us stay in touch with others. Many tasks would be to hard to complete without the computer."	2405	
2406	1	"Dear @CAPS1 editor, I think computers are a great help and advansement for our comunity. Computers allow you to get information on a report topic without having to drive to a library to check a book out. What if your relitive was in @LOCATION1 and your in @CAPS2 the only way to see and talk to them is by a computers webcam. Also if computers are used for hand-eye coordination, then you can do beter in sports like baseball which requires good hand-eye coordination. If your relitive is far away you could chat to them over the internet. Many people @MONTH1 think you could do this over the phone, but the computer actually lets you see the people and chat to them. So if you need to be at an important work confrence far away and you can't get there then you could use a webcam on the computer and talk to the people with out being there. All intelligent people know how great of an advansement a computer is for talking to people all over the country and world. So consider this idea as good uses for computers. What if you had a report and your library only had a couple books on that topic, what do you do now? Isn't it easier to just surch up the topic and have hundreds of resources to use? Well a computer can do that. All you have to do is go to a phrase in and you've got hundreds of resorces at your finger ties. So what is easier surchinh in a library or to the inter net were everything is at your figer tips. I think you'll all agree with me that a computer is easier and fastre. You know that most sports require good hand-eye coordination right. How would you feel if you couldn't do good in a sport because of bad hand-eye coordination. Well the computer could be used as hand-eye coordination in hansen. Play some games on the computer and you'll start to develope good hand-eye coordination. You'll be more active, because you feel confidnet you can do good in sport, now. So the computers can help people be active. you could even become the star player if you work hard enough. The time is now, I want you to print an article saying how imoportant coputers are to us. I mean computers help you with reports, you can talk far away relitives, even hand-eye coordination. I have great hand eye coordiantion from the computer and many other good skills have come from using the computer. So see these ideas as good and write an article."	2406	
2407	1	"To whom @CAPS2 @MONTH1 concern, I am writing this letter to you to tell you that computers have possitive effects on people and here are my reasons why. In my opinion compiters make life easier, bacause if you have a project instead of @CAPS3 flipping pages on a book, you can get the information @CAPS3 like that, the same thing with you job. Also you can send pictures and things to people faster instead of calling or walking to their homes. Secondly, its a faster way to talk to your friends. Driving wastes gas and you can get tired from walk so far, you can @CAPS3 go on the computer and send an @CAPS1 or messages. If you have something to say or share and the phone is busy or you dont have a cell, type in the thing you need to say and she'll get @CAPS2 fast. Lastly, computers have websites for people to learn how to do things, like typing if you dont know how to visit a website and @CAPS2'll help you right away. If your a new mommy to be and curious to know what to do, or how to do @CAPS2, @CAPS3 type in the site and @CAPS2'll have instructions and images showing you and telling you. In conclusion, I have told you all my statements in my opinion with supporting details."	2407	
2408	1	"I agree that computers has a good effect on people because they can learn more and explore the web search for things that you migh need for something important, @CAPS1 keep reading to hear my great idea. My first reason is to learn more it could be anything like animals and how they live in the jungle. You can also learn about what have is comeing out I did that once to look for spider @NUM1 and I liked it. My second reason is to explore the web for things or games you never saw befor it can inprove your learning abluits for whole lots of things you have never thought about befor. My last reason is to search for things that you might need to say, your @CAPS2 is crying but want to wacth @CAPS3 so turn your computer search for his favorite website like and he stoped crying and having fun he is happy and your happy. I hope you reader has liked my ideas for saving the computer is a help to people and your self if you use it in the right way that can help you secesed in life thank you for reading."	2408	
2409	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 think, everyone uses computer for certain reasons. Some people use it for billing and banks, jobs, online games, and chat sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. So, everyone uses a computer. I think that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and life today. Almost everying is online interactive. Which helps people learn hand-eye coordination, gives people ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even communicate online. To know how to type is a big part of most jobs. That's where hand-eye coordination comes into play. Most people know to type correctly, because it is a requirement to work for some jobs. Personaly I can not type correctly, which is bad for teenagers and children around my age. Most kids if they don't stat when they are young, will probably never learn. More than @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 still have difficulties typing. So computer programs that teach students how to type should be required in school acidemic programs. Learning about other people,cultures, and places could help kids understand differences about people. All people are different in some way shape or form. Simple applications like @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 could tell you things about the topic you type in. So, @CAPS5 and Computers come in handy when you want to learn new things. @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS7 are all online chat websites. With these sites you can talk and communicate with people around the world. These websites are very useful anyway. They are there if you need to tell someone something and remind people of things. @CAPS5 is @CAPS1 great. The computer helps people learn about hand-eye coordination, new cultures, and ways to communicate online. So @CAPS1 imagine the world with no computer."	2409	
2410	1	"Chances are, we all have computers in our lives. They're probably a big part @ORGANIZATION1 ourlives, too. Is this good? It depends who you ask. To me, computers are overtaking our world like lava over an erupting volcano. Coming on fast, leaving a hot mess in its wake. Computers are bad because users don't exercise as much as they should, they cost a lot @ORGANIZATION1 money, and users don't interact with their families as much as they would without them. Remember that volcano? Well, it can be applied to exercising as well. When you stop exercising, the comes on before you can stop it, just like lava. People who have jobs in the computer world often are sitting for @NUM1 hours a day, according to a @ORGANIZATION3 study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1. This is time that could be use running, lifting weights, on swimming. My dad, for one, loves the computer. He is working on launching a @ORGANIZATION3 website. This requires him to sit at the computer for @NUM2 hours nightly. He isn't exercising despite the tart taht he needs to which will hurt him in the longrun. @PERSON2 even commented to a @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2 article about weight that her sound and technology workers her songs all day are an average @NUM3 pounds overweight! This is a lot @ORGANIZATION1 mass that can hurt their bodies and life! My dad who is working on a website program spends a lot @ORGANIZATION1 money each year on the cmputers in our house. This is the other problem with computers. They cost a lot @ORGANIZATION1 money. My family recently spent @MONEY3 or when computer, which could have gone towards college for my sisters and @ORGANIZATION2 said that in @DATE2, over @MONEY1 was spent in the @LOCATION2 on computers. The, @CAPS2 and, too. In an economy like this, I find it ridiculous and pathetic that our nation can spend this much on computers but can't keep their homes. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION4 costs @MONEY3 an hour? Our world and nation would be much better off if we did things to help others, instead @ORGANIZATION1 worrying so much about our computer games and @CAPS3 that we would flush that money down the toilet. Speaking @ORGANIZATION1 wasting things because @ORGANIZATION1 computers, families are breaking apart because @ORGANIZATION1 them. The idea @ORGANIZATION1 a @DATE1 dinner together or a walk together is virtually forgotten in the majority @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION5 housholds. My dad couldn't come to a competition @ORGANIZATION1 mine because he had, to finish something for his computer, even though he didn't. It made me sad to think he wouldn't be there cheering me on. @PERSON1, who recently robbed a home in @LOCATION1 said that his parents weren't supportive @ORGANIZATION1 him growing up. so he got in trouble. They were always on the computer and didn't have time for him. The @ORGANIZATION3 discovered that families with parents always on the computer had kids with a median yearly income @MONEY2 less than those who had supportive parents. This is so sad, yet true. Computers have done more harm to the society than good, because @ORGANIZATION1 the cost, lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, and lack @ORGANIZATION1 family relationships."	2410	
2411	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you probably know there is a lot of contreversy about people and computers. It could go either way. Many people agree that others are using their comuter to much and not getting enough exercise. But on the other hand people believe it is helping with hand eye cordination and learning. I agree with both because sure some people @MONTH1 be on the computer to much but they could be designing technology that could help us. It all fits together scientists and doctors on these things every day. Kids use them to play games and sometimes use them to much. But they also use it for help them with their homewrok. There are some people that shouldn't be using their computers so much and we should try to get those people to do more active things. But we can't get every one to do that. Like scientists or doctors because the scientists are using them so much to help doctors create more efficent robotics. Also doctors are using computers so much to help they have. So I think we should just drop all this contreversy and get the people who use them to much to do some active things. And doctors and scientist just let them keep doing what they are doing."	2411	
2412	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think's computers are a bad influences on people. They will take away things that people need should enjoy. Like exensing, going at havig fun, or family time. Hear me out on what I have to say. First, computes will be bad because people will spend less time execising. People wat to get fit, but with all those distractions like facebook, @CAPS2 one all those things. It is very hard for people to pull away so they can exercise. when people can't exercise they can have in their body. Doctors probably wont want unhealthy people who in their operating room. Also when people get unhealthy they tend to get a little fat. When they a little fat people sometimes lose confidence or motivation. Then they dont do anything one thats right back to writing. Next, people wont get to see whats really all there in nature. Getting fresh air and sunlight the bay is a great idea, computers are a great distraction. There is so many other things to that do. People comp while they fish and hunt. For those wo can't to camp there is always skiing or snowboarding. In to @DATE1 ther swimming and other sports too. There so @MONTH1 other things that people could be doing. Instead of the computers, out of all those things, all of them go fun and who doesn't like fun. Finally, computer takes time away from family. Families are spending to much time on the computer with eachother. Families want stay with each other good way is to spend time with parents. Without communicating or bonding bad things can enter a kids life. Like drugs and smoking. Familes will have a much higher chance of this hot happening if they just spent time and bondded together so that way they can talk to their kids. Also a result in bonding with parents and the child is teenagehood. As in the child will the resent the parents more. This over the top, and stressing them and causing big fights or breaking. So if the kids got off the computer and with the family or went out did somethig together it would be less likely the kid will get in trouble with drugs parents wont have to be stressed out, and hate their kid all the way through teenagehood. In conclusion, computers are bad. They stop people from becoming healthy, takes away the great outdoors and has the potential to tear a family apart. So stay away computers as soon as possible so you can enjoy the many other things @CAPS3 has given us to enjoy."	2412	
2413	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 newspaper, I believe computers have positive effects on society. Computers benefit us by facilitating research, connecting friends and loved ones around the world, and they can even help make disabled peoples' lives easier. If used properly, computers enhance our day-to-day lives and prove to be a valuable resource and knowledge base. Have you ever had to find an answer to a question on the computer? Well, in order to do so, you simply must open @CAPS3 @CAPS4, log into a search engine, and type your question. However, to find an answer to a question without using a computer is a long and tedious process. First, you must drive to your local library, which is about @NUM1 minutes away for most @LOCATION1 citizens. Then, you must search to find a parking space, dig around in your wallet to find your library card, then trudge inside. Once in the library, you must laboriously pour over card catalogs, find your book, and search the index. ""I really love using the computer for research. @CAPS7 makes finding information fun and easy, whereas manualy searching books is difficult,"" says @PERSON1, an eighth grade student from @LOCATION2. As you can see, computers make research a much easier process for citizens. According to a recent @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 are involved in a long-distance relationship. Maintaining a long-distance relationship can be quite difficult. However, with the help of their computers, many couples succeed. Due to recent technologies, couples can now email, @CAPS6, or videochat on their computers. Citizens can also use these services to keep in touch with distant friends or family. For example, many of my relatives live in @LOCATION3, and by using email on the computer, we are able to communicate frequently and maintain a close bond. Overall, computers make long-distance communication/relationships manageable. When most adults need to purchase an item, they drive to a local store or supermarket. However, something as simple as this could prove to be impossible to a disabled person. Before the public used computers, disabled persons had to rely on friends or family to retreive their groceries and clothes. Using the computer, citizens can now order groceries, purchase houseware, and buy clothes. This is especially helpful to disabled people, since they can care for themselves while in the comfort of their own home. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT2 of disabled persons rely on the computer to purchase necessary items. Naturally, computers greatly enhance the @CAPS2 of disabled persons and provides them with a convienent alternative to outdoor shopping. In final conclusion, I believe computers improve the @CAPS2 of society. Whether they are used to speed up research and projects, connect with friends and family all over the world, or purchase things online. Computers truly benefit everyone. As long as people are still excercising and interacting with others, computers make peoples' lives easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. As the principal of my middle school once said, ""Computers are an invaluable tool, and, when used properly, can help you succeed in @CAPS2."" @CAPS7 is clear that computers help us to become a more informed, intelligent, and poised society as a whole."	2413	
2414	1	"Don't you just love the beautiful outdoors? The cute birds singing. The breath taking fields of flowers. Most of all the amazing creaters you can spot just outside your done step. So why spend your time on the computer when you take a glimps of all this? It has been sientifically researched that @PERCENT1 of people spend more time on computers outdoors. My sister is always on the computer constantly and I @DR1 it can get annoying because she never wants to do anything else. Also sitting on the computer all day isn't good for your body. It doesn't get your heart pumping like if you were to go take a mile jog. Some people might say the computer is good for you and your brain but they don't @DR1 what they're talking about. I noticed that as my friend @PERSON1 began to spend more time on the computer he started to go less with his friends and family. That is only one of the powerful effects computers have on you. It's like they're taking over your mind and not letting you do anything elese. They also stop you from spending the time you should be spending with your family. Every one knows spending some time with the family is always entertaining. Going on computers can also be dangerous. Kids can being doing things you're not aware about. Such as chating with people they don't @DR1 or even adding people on facebook they're familiar with. Dr. @DR1-it-all says this is how @PERCENT2 of teens get sexual assolted or murdered. I used to chat with people I didn't @DR1 online because I thought it was fun. But when I to think about all the dangers that could happen to me so I stopped. However, their are still thousands of kids doing it today. Like I said spending lots of time on computers can lead to not going out doors, spending to little time with family, getting sexual assaulted or even murder. So... What are you waiting for? Get off that computer and enjoy the fresh out doors with your friends!"	2414	
2415	1	"Do you like to use your computer most of the time? Well I believe you do. People around the world love to spend most of their time on the computers why well I have three reason why because there's special cool programs, amazing sites, also chat rooms… @CAPS1 move on to the first reasons why people spend most of there time on their computer. ""@CAPS2 my god the special cool programs are awesome"", these special programs can be educational to kids, teens, and adults. These programs can teach you how to speak any langue you choose. Their are many types of programs that are helpful to anyone in the world. It doesnt hurt to learn something you havent learn yet. Also not so bad to want to be on the computer for a while. While people enjoy learning cool things people also spend most of their time on their computer to visit new amazing site's people go on game site's to have a little fun indoors insteed of being outdoors so much. There are thousands of games to play from action to dress up games and all the games people enjoy no problem with that dont you agree with my thought about this. Well you should @CAPS1 go on foward with more reasons. You would find that most teens and adults enjoy chating with a friend who lives thousands of miles away from you. Most sites of chat rooms people stay on are @CAPS3.com, facebook, formspring.me ect. People love it because you can design ur on page write a little about yourself put up pictures of you and your friend and write about them. I say you should agree that useing ur computer most of the time dont hurt... Well with people loving to use computers going on the cool programs, amazing sites and also go on chat rooms it does not effect you by sitting down a while and use your fingers to do the work insteed of your feet so agree with me you most say iy's not a bad thing to do at all."	2415	
2416	1	"Dear newspaper I believe that it is ok for people to use computers because many kids use them for education, games and cheat codes from online sites many other people use computers to talk to friends and family if they are out of State. Other people use them for busnessAs letters and send work to there bosses. On @CAPS1 there was a man and he not on an @CAPS2 trio with his family and every time his family what to be he would pull out his laptop / computer to work on the letter as had to send to his boss he never finish the table and never set but his computer set stolen and the man used the computer to look up words for songs so he could learn them. and the other got use his to finish the email and send it to his boss it took to do it what I am saying is that everyone was a laptop to do some thing, to talk to friends or to play games when they have nothing else to do. I think that the ""events"" are wrong when it comes to the fact that some book do spend way to much time once computer what else are they do some people don't live act in the contry to go nature watching, in fact I was on my computer baxing puts for my bike because I needed new bike or @CAPS3 could not ride me bike. More reasons why people use computer is some people do protects for work school on computer I was doing a start on my favorite teacher before the @CAPS4 started and I don't now how @MONTH1 time i have loged on to the computer at my house or at school another reason why people use computers is teachers use computers to do the attendance at school to log in that student is here or not people are not on the computer @NUM1 unless they have nothing to do with there lives that are risk about the people do what they chose."	2416	
2417	1	"Dear the @CAPS1, I heard that you would like to hear my opinion on how computers have a big impact on people. Well I belive that computers do the same thing as nature. Dont you think? These are my reasons why I belive tha computers do benefit our society. My first reason is that we should still have computers because we are still able to interact with our family and friends and enjoy nature. My aunt is a very busy person, she almost never has time to talk or hang out with her friends so the way the communicate is by email and video chat so what @CAPS2 trying to say is many people in my city are very busy they almost dont have anytime to interact other if they have computers they would be able to. My second reason on why we should have computers is because it teaches people many things like hand-eye cordination. Not many people learn in an easy way but on the computer there are websites and links that can teach people how to use their hands in a quick and proper way. My third reason is if adults are planning to go on a trip to a far a way place but have no time to check out books or make reservations through the phone the could go onto the internet during and took up places they would enjoy to go to, They could make reservations on-line too. How would you feel if you were never able to make reservations on the line or online because theres no compoters? How would you see what the places look like? Okay now that you've heard my reasons on why computers are a great help what do you think? A world with computers is great but imagine a world without computers at home, a busy day not going to be home on time so wanna watch the news but theres no computers?? ""But"" if there were you would be up to date on everything. So now you heard my reasons tell me what you think?"	2417	
2418	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of debating and arguing going on about the benefits that computers have on society, and specifically if it is currently helping people on a daily basis, or @CAPS5 making it worse for them. Those who support technological advances are especially supportive of the opinion that computers only have a positive affect on life. As much as I like computers, and use them also, I am here today to tell you why it's use and advances should become limited. My first reason as to why computers aren't @CAPS5 affecting society for the better positively, is one that I'm sure that experts will support: exercise time. With all that technology offers today, how will we have time to exercise? ""@CAPS2 with computers I hardly have time to go to the gym"" and ""I haven't worked out in a long time, ever since I bought a new laptop"", are comments that are typically heard. Personally, I don't blame these people! I too find it very hard to fit in ""working out"" on my agenda, ever since I bought a home computer. However, doctors say (and studies @CAPS3) that daily exercise is esential for a physical and mental well-being, along with longitivity. This is especially true and important for children, who are starting to use computers more and more. This brings me to my second reason as to why use of technology should be limited. Even though exercise is one thing computers have taken away from many people (especially children), they also create many other short and long term health hazards, including eye damage, obesity, brain damage and heart problems. As frightening as this @MONTH1 seem, it is all true. How can these computers even be sold legally? Although most of these issues happen after prolonged use of a computer (usually hours at a time), doctors have estimated that this will affect alot more people since children begin using computers at a much younger age. ""I don't want my child to grow up to be blind!"" is what one mother told me after hearing about this. From personal experience, I @CAPS4 that after using my computer for @CAPS5 an hour, I can't see very clearly so imagine over years of usage! Lastly, computer use (especially at a younger age) affects something very important in our system: survival instincts. It has been medically proven that since so much information can be found using a computer, that we grow a dependance for it! What will happen if computers dissapear one day? ""@CAPS5 think of the @CAPS6!"" my neighboors exclaimed. Even I use the computers maps alot, and sometimes, if I am without one, I will forget where I am! It doesn't seem big at first, but it can cause alot of damage in the long run. These are my reasons as to why computer use should be limited. I can understand how some people create them to help us, but the truth is that they are doing @CAPS5 the opposite. I hope you take my opinion into consideration."	2418	
2419	1	"Dear @CAPS1 To @CAPS2 Local @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Computers are a big part of teenagers life. But @CAPS5 your really think about it computers do more to a teens brain then you think. They get addicted to being on line with friends then paying attention to things that really matter. But compputers is also a device that makes life easier for a lot of things. Having a computer a good things or a bad thing. I have no clue. Some example of good things that a computer can be used for is learning. The thing that gets you through life or economy countrys around the world, And can also help the world too. By buying things over the interent, and aslo finding a @CAPS6 @CAPS7.Also speaking of meeting people you can also get in contract with people you haven't seen in ages. Compoters make life so much easier for everyone around. But there are also bad things about computers too. It's very easy to get into a lot of trouble by doing one thing. Things like going on websites like myspace, facebook and so on. @CAPS5 you put one bad thing on like a comment or a photo people start thingking of you in a bad way. But only depending on what you put on the internet. And not only the people you know see it. everyone else around the world see it. Anothing people can find out your number and address then stalk you. Instead of getting all yourself in this mess teens should just go out and explore more. And many out with there friends and family. There's really no need to go on the computers. Thats why you have school and school books or the lybrary. All of the things you do on computers you can also do with using it. So there's really no need. I hope you have thought about what I have said. It's more that just words. There's a good and a bad side. You choose"	2419	
2420	1	"Every year, @PERCENT1 more of the @ORGANIZATION1's population get computers. In addition, multiple people agree that computers have a positive efect everyone. They give people the ability to do things faster and better. Many civilians in @LOCATION1 think that using the computer to communicate with others is simpler than having to look up a number to call someone with your phone. You could always type a wrong number in or have bad service from your phone company, but computers have e-mail and other places, where you can program your friends' and familys' emails ' in. For e-mail, you just type in what you want to say, press ""enter,"" and then you're ready to go; the message would imediately send to your friend. You also can add clipart or recorded voices on your message to add some fun or pizazz. Therefore, you as part of the local newspaper, must agree that computer's are very good for people to have. ""@CAPS1 have very messy handwriting, nowadays, and it is very difficult to grade papers with this problem,"" complained @PERSON1, a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 middle school. Computers allow you to type essays, project captions, etc. It gives teachers a break from messy writing for good! @CAPS1 can always rely on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 to correct their spelling and grammar. Teachers love an edited paper that they can understand completely. Surely, computers are great for education at schools. @CAPS1 and adults can use computers for reseach. They can go on websites such as @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 to search for great websites that lead you to the information that you are looking for. You can find all you need on the internet quicker than a single person can snap rather than searching through books you aren't evensure of to give you the information you need. Many teachers find their worksheets and rubrics online. @CAPS1 can find fact about the past or on any specific animal. What all people are sure of is that they @MONTH1 not have to waste their time looking in a book for hours again! In conclusion, you, as part of the local newspaper must agree that computers are the one thing that book's can't beat. They will guarantee you quick information without you having to search through books. Say goodbye to messing up numbers on the telephone because computers are here to help you on whatever you need."	2420	
2421	1	My opinion of the effect computers have on people is that people arent safe. A lot of teens and kids on on their computers and go to yahoo + or my space to talk to their friends. but sometimes teen talk to people they don’t know that can hurt them and tell them something that makes them uncomfortible. I like computers really I do and I know you like it too but sometimes you have to be careful when you surfing the web . Another effect computers have on people is that people arnt healthy. Kids and teens even abults dont go outside to exercise or get fresh air because they are too busy at their house playing on their computer. That why alot of kids and adults gain alot of weigh because they dont stop messing with their computer. you would not want to get fat because your not takeing care of your body because you are playing on the computer. My third reason computer have effect on people is that they arent learning. Kids are just play mini games on their computes and arent leaning anything. They can have homworke and forget how to do it because they was too busy play games on their computer. They could go to school and then a teacher can be teaching them somthing like math. The lesson the kids could be thinking about the game they play on their computer. Like how to pass a level in the games or how to score points. and after the lesson is over they wouldnt learning anything because they wasnt paying attection you wouldnt want your kids spent too much time on the computer and not know anything. My fourth effect computers have effect on people is that people get into trouble by gettlog music off the internet and not paying back and they can go jail. You woulnt want to go to jail.	2421	
2422	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I belive computers do benefit society. Computers are actually important to people now. If you havend talked to your family or friends in a while you can start talking to them again. Entertainment too. It's not just a piece of technology for research or educational things say you ask a question (educational or not) you will find an awnser. You can communicate with family and friends over any distance by a computer. I had a friend that I didn't talk to for two years but then I got a computer last christmas and we gotta catch up the computer is very helpful for peole. I read in a time magizene yesterday and it said that ""@PERCENT1 of people think computers are entertaining and usefull"". Most people I know have computers. Computers have almost everything on them. From good things to bad. Mainly entertainment for most people. If you use your computer you can find all sorts of things. From game's to everything in between. There are millions of games to play on there are websites like funny junk.com that will make you laugh in under a minute. There's also youtube where you @MONTH1 watch music videos, @CAPS3 shows, or how to videos. A computer can awnser any question if you go online. You can type in math problem and the be. You can type in any question and they'll be awnbered. Yester. I needed to know how long this going to take to download so I divide @NUM1 + @NUM2. While computers can answers any question they can also do riddles and much more. Computers are good for many things. There good for comunicating (which is what people do. They can also be entertainment for everyone these little machines can take any question you through at them. As you can probably tell im not the only one who thinks this."	2422	
2423	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @DATE1, computers are a house hold staple. Many people are required to own one for school, and later on work: Computers are a great form of technology! Computers allow us to learn about diffrent people, places, and things going on in our world. Computers also allow to talk to online that are far away, you can even see them if you use video chat. I love that we can see people and only talk to them because my brothers in the army and I like to make sure hes okay. Some people use video chat at work for online confernces. People who own or even run buisnessis use computers to keep track of their scedual, make aters, and pay bills. Computers are not always used for work they can also be used as a luxtury. Children and @CAPS2 all over the world love to play games on their computer systems weather they are online or not. My dad and I love in play pinball with each other and other people online, I love some one halfway around the world. I am probly on my computer at least two hours on a @TIME1 and five hours on a @TIME1 end! That is really not a concern for me untill my sister and I get into an altercation over takeing turns. The reason it is not realy a concern for me is because I am an alstar athelet and I work out at least @DATE2 hours a @TIME1. I actually belive that it is helping my friends and I with hand-eye coordination, we have noticed that we can catch facts more accuratly in mounts or drible a basket ball faster or thow a ball right where your aiming. As you can see my friends and I are very involved in our sports. I do not belive that @LOCATION1 is haveing a problem with staying fit or not interacting with our friends or family. Computers do not seem to be harming our comunity only improving it!"	2423	
2424	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers. Do you use computers to type your articles? The computer is the greatest invention of all time. It teaches hand-eye coordination, you could see what the world is like outside of @LOCATION3 and you could communicate with other people. Also you type your news articles with a computer. Do you have a dream? Well almost everything you do has hand-eye coordination. Sports, instruments and even video games all use hand-eye coordination. The computer teaches you how to use your hands and your eyes at the same time. You type emails while looking out at the screen and you play computer games while looking at the screen. Overall, computers help you with hand-eye coordination. Do you need a vacation? But you don't have eneough time to take off from work. Maybe you want to go to the @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or maybe even @LOCATION4. Instead of spending all that money though you could go on your compute and look up all the places you want to go, and learn about them at home on your computer. @CAPS9, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS7, @CAPS6 and I chat are all ways to communicate to your colleagues. @CAPS10 your sick and can't get to work you could just @CAPS7 your boss from your computer and tell him. In fact, @PERCENT2 of adults use @CAPS7 or @CAPS8 to instant message people. also, @PERCENT3 of the entire world uses @CAPS9. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS9 was a country it would be bigger than @LOCATION1 ""said @PERSON1 from Time magazine. Almost everyone with a computer will agree that computers are the easiest way to communicate. In conclusion, The computer is the greatest invention because it teaches hand-eye coordination you learn about the world, and you could communicate with others. What do you think? Do you need to learn hand-eye coordination, or learn about @CAPS12 with out leaving your hose you decide @CAPS10 computers benefit society."	2424	
2425	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the time quotes fly through my ears even as ""technology is a brighter future,"" or ""technology will bring success."" @CAPS4 hearing these types of things being said, I agree. Technology has brought over millions of people world-wide to one computer screen to share the same experience. I believe computers bring many benefits to everyone's daily life, such as being able to interact with family and friends, having the ability to learn new information on the computer, and the computer is ""school friendly."" @CAPS5 school friendly I mean the ability for students to get a better education over the computer. With the poor economy, execessive amounts of people don't have jobs. Although, with the click of a button hundreds even thousands of jobs can be listed in or around your area. Finding a career is also another option with a computer. Everyday I watch commercials about online colleges. another thing you can learn about on the computer is about your health. Experts say people spend more time on the computer rather than exercising. The computer provides information supporting your health and fitness. Not only can a computer provide new information about jobs, careers, and your health but also new academic information. Children and adults can go online and find accurate information about academic subjects. Computers have benefits to mine and millions of others everyday lives. More and more students go online everyday to participate in school subjects on the internet. Students have the ability to find out and complete homework assigned to them through simple websites such as classjump.com or studyisland.com. it has been brought to my attention a student might be spending more time on the computer but after the student has completed the assignment he or she can continue their daily activities. Also, some websites have walkthroughs on how to perform a certain experiment or math complication. Lastly, students are able to write papers on the computer, print them out, and have them ready for the teacher. The computer has made a students and teachers life easier @CAPS5 the computer. The last reason computers bring benefits to society is you are able to interact with people online. Certain websites can help you stay in contact with family members who have moved or lost touch with. The internet also provides safe websites to meet new people or catchup with old high school reunion over a public website. Computers provide the information to interact with people you have lost contact with. As you can see, a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and screen have done wonders to many citizens lives. Using this devise has let people have the ability to learn on a computer. Also, it has let students get a brighter education. Last, the computer has given people the opportunity to stay in touch with old friends or family. The computer has its negatives too, but has twice as many positives."	2425	
2426	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a part of our everyday lives in this centry. Everywhere you go technology is always being used. This is why I strongly bealive that computers have a positive effect on us. They impact so many useful things. First computer help us to do things faster and easyer. Sencond they are the new social networks that help comunicating online. Lastly they help organize files like in offices. These are the reasons I bealive computers have a big positive effect on society. My first reason was computers help us do things a lot faster. For example, doing research you just type in the topic and in seconds you have thousands of webpages to look from. Way faster then going from book to book looking for the information you need. Also shopping never got easyier with online shopping. Its fast and easy insted of having to go through the hosel of driving far to a store when you can do it instently. People have very busy lives and computers just make it a whole lot easyer. My second reason is computers are the new social network and comunication all over the world! Everyone wants to keep up with their friends, but we cant always have the time to see there. So online chatting helped us fix that. Or when your on the phone you can only have a one way conversation... Boring. but on computers wow you can talk up to as many people that you want simotanisly. Alot for big companys that work with other countries computers helped them alot because they can talk about things without having to always use the companys money to fly out over there. Saving Society time and money! Computers come with webcams so its like your comunicating in person even if they live millions of miles away. This is why computers are help in the social society. The last reason why computer are a positive impact on todays society is because they are the best storing machines ever. Alot of offices have alot of papers and they can always get easly lost or misplaced. however, with computers its a fast way to store the information offices need. Just think about it going to a office with no computers it would take forever to find the papers and information beacause they would have to look from files to files. This is why companys store all their information on the computer. It's just simply fast and easy. These are the three reasons why I strongly bealive that computers are a possitive effect on society. First you can do all your reaseach fast and online, shopping never been easyer. Secondly, online comunications are fast and easy to keep in touch. And lastly it helps offices organize their stuff better. As a result of this you can agree with me that computers are very possitive and they make our lives so much easyier. From a local newspaper reader."	2426	
2427	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard in the news paper that more and more people us computers today. Computers have a major effect on how people are today. In fact, I read in the ""Time"" magazine that over @PERCENT1 of the people in the @LOCATION1 have changes the way they are and how they act in their everyday life. I for one, believe that computers don't benefit society. My first reason why I beleive that computers don't benefit society is that more and more kids are starting to stay inside on the computer all day rather than going out to play and get exercise. If all the kids in the @LOCATION2 stayed inside all day everyday would be filled with sick and obese children. If the world gets filled with that, it would be total kayoss and people would be left and right the world and humanity as we know it could be destroyed kids are definilly not benefited from at all. That is my first reason why I beleive that computers don't benifit our society. My second reason for why - beleive that computers are not a benifit to society is their people will lose the ability to communicate. In the world to day, people communicate talking face to face, and on the computer. If more and more people start to communicate threw the computer, eventually people won't talk face to face. Communication is a big part of society. Communication is what keeps the world running the way it does. If computers get in the way of that, some bad and dangerous things happen for example, the computer in the space shuttle failed in @DATE1 and that are computer took @NUM1 lives. That is my second reason why computers don't benefit our society. My last reason for why that computers dont benefit our society is that people lose the ability to work. Most things in our world today are all computerized. People aren't doing much work except. If everything is computerized, people will lose the ability to work, what if computers fails, people going to do their jobs if they don't have a clue about what to do? That is my last reason why I beleive that computers do not benefit our society. So, in conclusion, I beleive that computers do not benefit our society. I beleive this because kids aren't exercising, people are losing the ability to communicate and lastly people are lossing there abillity to work. I know that you should publish this in the paper because it will change some people opinions, for your time."	2427	
2428	1	"Computers are a very good peace of technology and people should be using them. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and you can talk to your friends online. Finally you can learn a lot of @CAPS3 on things you need to learn about. Computers teach hand eye coordination from when you type and when you read what you type. It can get your hands faster and stronger. Also you will be more alert when your talking to people or trying to focus on your homework or something like that with a computer you can talk or even meet new friends. With facebook if you have a webcam you can see the person if they have a webcallm and you can talk to them. With facebook you can make a profile with @CAPS3 about you. You can also put videos and photos of you and your friends up on your page. Finally you can play games and talk with friends. With twitter you only can post what you are doing or feeling. So if I'm eating a ham and cheese sandwich then I could say I'm eating a ham & cheese sandwich and people comment on your post. Finally you can @CAPS1 someone to date on a website like @CAPS1 a @LOCATION1. It's were you write down what you are like and it matches you with someone who is similar. Some people have gotten married thanks to those websites. Finally you can learn a lot of @CAPS3 online. First though you need websites that will help you @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 you want. Those websites are called search engines, like @LOCATION2, @CAPS2.com, or @CAPS3. com. They really are easy and quick websites to @CAPS1 what you need. But I pretty much always use @ORGANIZATION1 because it's easy and gets you what you need. You can look for websites, photos, maps, and videos with @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 finds the website that you need that has the @CAPS3 for a project of yours or even homework. I had a project on @LOCATION3 nad country in @LOCATION4 and I found everything I needed to know from @ORGANIZATION1 it's a life saver. So this is why the computer is very useful and why everyone should be using one."	2428	
2429	1	"Dear Readers of the local Newspaper, @NUM1 @CAPS1 has come to my concern that many people are debating weather the good out weighs the bad on computers. I'm writing this letter to state my opinion, computers have a greater negitive effect on people. First of all, computers increase the chance of pediphilies being able to get away with their successful crime. Also, there are also many cybes-bullies on the internet. Thirdly, c hildren and teens often choose going on the computer over exercising. Did you know before the internet there were @PERCENT1 less pediphile crimes than after introduced to children? as technology in our world increases, @CAPS1 becomes easier for @LOCATION1 to kidnap children. some kids are being introduced to internet without parental guidance, kidnapping children is easier than ever for @LOCATION1. Now @PERCENT2 of children who go online without parental vision are kidnapped and reaped of that @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are then murdered. Do we want to put our kids at that kind of risk? You might be saying ""ohh that will never happen to my kids, I watch what they do online!"" @CAPS2, your kids can go on while your not looking. These days @PERCENT4 of children over @NUM2-years-old can turn on the computer and get to a chat room by themselves. Chat rooms are the home to @PERCENT5 of all @LOCATION1. Why would you want to put children in the kind of situation? Not only are chat rooms to over @NUM3 @LOCATION1, they also hold over @NUM7.@NUM2 @CAPS3 cyber bullies. Your kids or teens could be harassed on the internet by cyber-bullies every day. This will ruin their self-esteem and could lead your kids into depression. There are a total of about @NUM5 @CAPS3 people who visit chat roooms. That gives your child (or children) a @NUM6 in @NUM7 chance that they will chat with a cyber-bully each time they go on the internet. why put your child in that kind of emotional torture? The internet can murder your child literally by introducing them to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1 can cause your child to commit suicide after being cyber-bullied. But the internet can also cause your child to die of obesity causes. The time your child spend on the internet takes away from the time they be exercising. Did you know @PERCENT6 of children in @LOCATION2 don't exercise the recommended @NUM8 minutes a-day. Did you know @PERCENT7 of those kids spend atleast an hour on the internet every day? If we took away the computer from them they would probably spend that time exercising. That would improve the health of our children and increase their life expectancy. Don't you want your children to be healthy? Do you want your child or the children in our community to encounter a pediphile? Do you want them to be cyber-bullied? Do you want more and more children to become obease? If you answered no to of these questions you would agree that the negitive out weighs the positive for computers. Sure, the computer can get you alot of information about faraway places, but can't books do the same? "	2429	
2430	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I know it has come to your concern that computers can effect people in bad ways I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers can let you interact with friends, research, and ask questions. These things can increase your knowledge, and you can talk to your friends at the same time. First, I think computers have good effects on people because you can interact with friends. Sites like facebook can allow you to reconnect with your old friends, and see how their doing in life.

Second if they didn't exercise before what makes them want to exercise now? Third it maks it easier to access a bank account or look up information. First people in banks have to use computer. For example it lets them count faster and not make a mistake on the withdraw or mess up on the deposite. Second if they didn't exercise befor what makes them want to exercise now? On the law it said ""freedom of rights"" so they don't have to exercise if they don't want to. Third I makes it easier for some people to look up in formation and access bank accounts instad to going to the bank and wast some time. For example millions and millions of people look on google.com to find information or go to www.gamesstop.com preorder a new game. I hope you will consider my ideas."	2431

For one computers can teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and also allows people to talk online with other people. Computers teaches people many things for example hand-eye coordination. Some people with problems with there hand and eye coordanation @MONTH1 had gottan a little better because of useing and going on an computer. Computer also give people the ability to learn about faraway places many people have gotton injuries and have disabled them from exploring the world but by going on the computer there able to learn explore and even look at pictures and videos on where ever the want to explore and learn about. Most importantly by having computers people will be able to chat/talk with friends and family members that they @MONTH1 not get to see also be able to send videos and picture as well just by having a computer. So now you see why having an computer or going on one is a good thing and why the bring people say!!"	2432
